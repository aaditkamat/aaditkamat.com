Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved."),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"get-enough-sleep"},"Get enough sleep"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working.
