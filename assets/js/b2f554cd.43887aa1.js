He approaches Dr Bob Ellis to tell him about his unique situation: he has been experiencing weight loss, even as his mass has remained unchanged. Furthermore, he weighs the same undressed as he does with several layers of clothing on. Dr Bob, at first, does not believe Scott\u2019s predicament, but is forced to accept it when Scott demonstrates using the doctor\u2019s own precise weighing scales.\\n\\nScott has a strained relationship with his neighbours Dierdre McComb and Missy Donaldson, a married lesbian couple that has recently moved into Castle Rock. Scott is annoyed that Dierdre continues to let her dogs do their business in his lawn. Whenever Scott tries to share his problem with Dierdre, she dismisses him with a smile that indicates that she is least interested to listen to him. Scott hopes that they will be on good terms and that Dierdre behaves more like a good neighbour.\\n\\nScott soon finds out why the couple is unhappy in Castle Rock. Deirdre and Missy\u2019s restaurant in Castle Town, Holy Frijole, has not been doing that well as of late. A major reason behind this is that the town\u2019s inhabitants disapprove of Diedre and Missy because they openly declared themselves as a married lesbian couple. Castle Rock is in a county politically inclined towards Republican ideology and the residents see this open declaration as a form of political statement. \\n\\nScott tries to stand up for the ladies as one of the employees in the Castle Rock Public Works department makes unsavoury comments about them. However, this makes things only worse, because Deirdre feels that they had been cast again into the spotlight, just as their sexual orientation was fading away from the minds of Castle Rock\u2019s residents\\n\\nIn a last attempt to make amends, Scott decides to participate in the town\u2019s annual 12K Thanksgiving run, an event that Dierdre is also participating in, and place a wager on the winner of the competition. Diedre is a skilled marathon runner and is confident of her chances of winning. She hopes that winning will be a shot at redeeming lost glory, a chance to show to the others in Castle Rock that she is more than just her sexual orientation. Even though Scott looks clearly out of shape, he feels optimistic about his chances due to his weight loss.\\n\\nScott easily clears the first 8K of the marathon, but starts struggling for the next 2K, until the \u201cwind changes\'\' and he regains his momentum. Towards the end, in the midst of heavy rain and thunder that erupts as the weather changes, he overtakes Dierdre and even helps her up to her feet when she stumbles, so that she can go on to win the race. The incident is reported in the local newspaper and Scott\u2019s act of kindness is lauded by the Castle Rock residents. Holy Frijole\u2019s business starts to boom, and Dierdre warms up to Scott.\\n\\nAfter the race, Scott meets Dierdre and Missy for lunch, along with Doctor Bob and his wife Myra, as per the terms of the wager that Scott won. Scott then confides with them about the weird phenomenon he has been experiencing. The rate at which Scott had been losing weight had accelerated and he was expecting to be weightless by January next year. \\n\\nThis revelation brings all of them even closer. They try to make the most of Scott\u2019s last few days, meeting up for lunch often at Holy Frijole. Scott wants Deidre to be the one that sets him free at the point where he loses all his weight, because he knows that she understands the feeling of being \u201celevated\u201d - a state she herself reaches when she runs for a marathon, where she can forget all the blemishes of her character and become the best version of herself. \\n\\nEven though Scott is going to die, he does so with the knowledge that he will not die buried in the ground, but rather soaring up in the skies.\\n\\n## Thoughts\\n\\nI have heard about Stephen King a lot from my friend. Of course, I have also enjoyed the films Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, which are based on his novels. He is a very talented storyteller, who is able to draw you into the story right from the beginning. \\n\\nThe premise of this novel is novel: who would have thought a person would die of weightlessness on Earth, as the gravitational pull on him decreases rapidly? It is yet again Stephen King foray into the supernatural. He hints at a reality that is outside human understanding. As Scott says, weight is just a construct that helps man understand his physical reality better like time. \\n\\nThe book is not nearly as dark or foreboding as some of the other Stephen King ones, because Scott is generally happy even though he is acutely aware of his terminal illness. He is also able to make amends with the McCombes and enlist the help of Dierdre for his final journey. \\n\\nThough I have never been to a small town in America - the closest is probably the college town of Chapel Hill which I visited during my exchange - I felt a sense of warmth reading about the close relationships that the town\u2019s inhabitants share, even if it accompanies the gossip and the prejudices often associated with a closed mentality. It reminded me of the TV Shows I have watched or books I have read about the villages in India or small towns in England."},{"id":"lessons-from-a-codementor-events-talk","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/lessons-from-a-codementor-events-talk","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2022-05-03-lessons-from-a-codementor-events-talk.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-03-lessons-from-a-codementor-events-talk.md","title":"Lessons from a Codementor Events talk","description":"Early this morning, I attended a talk given by Nadia Zhuk, a software engineer at Intercom and mentor at Meet a Mentor, on the Codementor Events platform.

This talk was geared not just toward other software developers but also toward those looking to break into tech. In this talk, Nadia shared her experience with translating lessons learned from coding into her writing with her audience. \\n\\nBefore working at companies like [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) and Intercom as a software engineer, Nadia was a news reporter and a copywriter. This work led her to different places, from Belarus to Israel to Ireland and London, where she now lives. \\n\\n# Takeaways\\n\\nThese are my takeaways from the talk:\\n\\n## Lesson #1: Learn to embrace failure\\n\\nNadia had a tough time preparing for her coding interviews at Zendesk. She had barely picked up HTML after struggling with it and even giving up a couple of times. She felt that her skills were up to the mark, even though she had some development experience before applying to Zendesk. Even after cracking the interviews, she felt that collaborating with senior developers in the team who were much more skilled would be pretty daunting. \\n\\nHowever, Nadia slowly learned to bite the bullet and embrace failure. Since her work at companies like Zendesk and Intercom needed to be of a high standard, Nadia realized that she had to take all the feedback on her work in her stride. \\n\\nThis is one of the first lessons she applied to her writing: she had to be comfortable with the negative criticisms she received for the first draft of her book. She found it difficult to do so because her editor told her that the draft felt incoherent and structured more like a series of long blog posts rather than a novel. It lacked a proper narrative flow. \\n\\nNadia shared that while she was gracious enough in accepting failure initially, she learned a lot from her editor\'s feedback for the first draft that she could apply to her other drafts.\\n\\n## Lesson #2: Learn from the best\\n\\nAnother major lesson that she applied from her coding experience was to learn from the best. When she first started developing in Ruby, she referred to books written by some of the most widely known and respected engineers in the Ruby community. Even though their writings sometimes went over her head, she did not give up and instead used her inability to grasp concepts as opportunities to slowly but surely improve her craft. \\n\\nBefore drafting [her book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56082981-crossing-the-rubycon), Nadia had read books written by great authors such as [Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing), [William Zinsser](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well), and [Oscar Wilde](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2417381.The_Collected_Oscar_Wilde), amongst others, who dispensed some valuable lessons on writing.\\n\\n## Lesson #3: Get yourself unstuck by talking it out\\n\\nProgramming can be a rather tedious affair. You have to often spend a significant amount of time discovering bugs in your code, sometimes even more than writing all that code in the first place. When developers get frustrated working on their programs, they often resort to a technique colloquially known as [\\"talking to the rubber duck.\\"](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) This means that developers review their code in greater detail and talk through it during the review. Some developers use a rubber duck as a persona to communicate their thoughts verbally, but catching hold of another developer works just fine. \\n\\nWriting, similarly, is nefariously hard and can feel even more lonely as the lone writer does most of the heavy lifting, at least during the drafting process. Talking through the writing helps the writer combat the loneliness that accompanies the writing process and get the ball rolling when the [writer\'s block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block) impedes progress.\\n\\n## Lesson #4: Learn to \\"be a pro\\"\\n\\nAnother invaluable lesson Nadia learned is to \\"be a pro.\\" This sounds rather generic, but Nadia meant to say that she learned to respect her side projects, in this case, the writing project, as she would her day-to-day work. \\n\\nInitially, she would leave most of her writing work for the weekends and could not find the discipline to stick to a schedule. She realized soon enough, however, that she would not be able to finish her writing on time this way. Hence, she started to write on other days of the week and even during vacations. \\n\\nEach day she wrote, she stuck to the task of writing until she was sure that she had nothing more to write that day. Being consistent and showing up counts more than talent most of the time, and this, Nadia feels, can be used to accomplish many goals that initially seem quite daunting. \\n\\n## Lesson #5: Get feedback early\\n\\nNadia had shown her first draft to the editor only after two months of grokking through it. In retrospect, she regrets delaying the process of getting feedback from her editor as she had to rewrite significant chunks during her second draft. That is why she feels that it is essential to get feedback as early as possible and get the book\'s overall structure outlined and approved before diving into the actual writing. \\n\\nIn a way, it\'s helpful to approach writing with an [agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) mindset, shipping out the work fast and iterating several times based on the feedback, just like you would when you ship software by following agile processes.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe primary lesson Nadia wished to impart through this talk was that she could successfully transition into her developer role because she reviewed the skills from her previous roles and tried to find some overlap with the skills required for her new roles. When she could not find that overlap, she approached the process of skill building like a craftsman: picking up things from scratch, refining her skills with inputs from the best, and learning to embrace the failures. \\n\\n# Q & A\\n\\nDuring the Q & A section, the first question I asked Nadia was about her writing tools. She replied that she had not invested in any fancy writing software. Instead, she chose to stick to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com), where she could get comments from her editor. In addition to Google Docs, she used [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/) for writing suggestions beyond the simple grammatical and spelling checks carried out on Google Docs.\\n\\nI also asked her about her blogging experience. While she said that she did not blog much before becoming an author and only does so occasionally even now, she wrote a lot when she studied journalism and learned a good bit about writing as a copy editor. Even though she learned about writing in Russian, she was able to use her understanding of the mechanics of writing in one language to guide her writing in another language, English."},{"id":"meditating-on-loving-kindness","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/meditating-on-loving-kindness","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2022-03-27-meditating-on-loving-kindness.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-27-meditating-on-loving-kindness.md","title":"Meditating on Loving Kindness","description":"The loving-kindness meditation is an excellent daily meditation.

Every now and then, I love coming back to it and hope that I will do so even more in the future.\\n\\nThis meditation teaches you the power of selfless, unconditional love. The practice of unconditional love appears in a lot of ancient traditions and cultures around the world. \\n[The Agape tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape), [the Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) and [Vasudhaiva Kutumbakham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhaiva_Kutumbakam) are just some of the traditions that leap to mind. \\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Agape_feast_03.jpg\\" alt=\\"Agape feast\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Agape feast </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Elephant_parade_ubuntu_1.jpg/1200px-Elephant_parade_ubuntu_1.jpg\\" alt=\\"Elephant statue with Ubuntu motif\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Elephant statue with Ubuntu motif </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Sansad_Bhavan%2C_Delhi%2C_BNK.jpg/1200px-Sansad_Bhavan%2C_Delhi%2C_BNK.jpg\\" alt=\\"Upanishad verse engraved in the entrance hall of the Parliament of India\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Upanishad verse engraved in the entrance hall of the Parliament of India </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nThere are times when I am misanthropic, when I feel that our humanity is rotten to the core and we cannot expect any better. This happens often when I explore the dark side of humanity, especially as it is depicted in some forms of media. \\n\\nIn the media, human drama appears to emphasize both the positive and negative sides of human behaviour, often not in conjunction but rather separately. Therefore, we end up focusing on only one side, rather than seeing both sides equally, as we would if we observed human behaviour daily. \\n\\nWe also tend to focus more on the negative side of things because of our [negativity bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/negativity-bias), where as many as [five positive experiences may be required to overcome the effects of one negative experience](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/).\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://images.prismic.io/thedecisionlab/da54d547-18f1-4442-b977-59ab514d3d5c_Negativity+bias.jpg?auto=compress,format\\" width=\\"700px\\" alt=\\"Negativity bias comic\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Negativity Bias </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nAt some point though, even these positive and negative labels do not suffice to describe human experiences. It employs a [binary mode of thinking](https://medium.com/@JayBeDreamin/the-dangers-of-binary-thinking-why-context-matters-f69fe1f4a2e2) as a heuristic to simplify a complex world.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvTK3d-haDV8oD60JrmZDA.png\\" alt=\\"Binary thinking\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Binary Thinking </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nFirst, there is some degree of subjectivity involved in evaluating experiences this way, as what appears positive to one may appear negative to another and vice versa. Second, there is a major chunk of human experiences that simply cannot be categorised this way.\\n\\nTake for instance a person travelling on a bus or a train. If the person is enjoying themselves having a conversation with another, they can label that experience as positive. On the other hand, if they get into an altercation with the person during that conversation, they can label that experience as negative. But what about all the time spent in between where the person is not engaged in one thing or the other? Both the labels do not suffice to categorize such an experience. \\n\\nOn an individual level, therefore, taking stock of your [roses, thorns and buds](https://lifedesignlog.com/rose-thorn-bud-activity-for-group-presentations/) helps you analyse your experiences on a spectrum.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://lifedesignlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rose-thorn-bud-activity-descriptions.png\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Rose, Thorn & Bud </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nContrasted with the destructive feeling of misanthropy is the feeling of unconditional love that I find myself gravitating towards more strongly. I feel that it holds greater power and leaves you with a more lasting feeling of contentedness, even if it is just as temporal as all other feelings are. \\n\\nThis meditation teaches you how to practice unconditional love by thinking of it as [expanding your circle of moral compassion](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals). You start with yourself, branch out towards your kith and kin, your colleagues and friends, your countrymen, other humans and ultimately towards all beings.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1595561372/Moral_circles_1_romx1m.png\\" />\\n<figcaption align=\\"center\\"> Moral circles visualization </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nDo give this meditation a try.

Objective realities are those that exist independent of our individual sensations and experiences (e.g. physical forces that have existed since the creation of the universe) while subjective realities arise from individual sensations and experiences (e.g. emotions like pain, anger, and love that feel real but cannot be detected by others). They do not believe in abstract concepts like God, Money, and the Economy. \\n\\nOur might as a species does not stem from individual intelligence or extraordinary toolmaking capabilities. If so we could have conquered the world much earlier, as an average Homo Sapiens in a hunter-gatherer band was more skilled than an average Homo Sapiens in the modern era. \\nInstead, it is due to increasingly sophisticated mechanisms of large-scale collaborations, made by possible a web of intersubjective realities, that have transformed us from those who sharpen flintstones to those who can now travel in space and dream of conquering other civilizations.\\n\\nMany philosophical texts have alluded to the concept of [reality as an illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis#Origins). A popular proposal that explores this concept further is the [\\"Simulation Hypothesis\\"](https://www.simulation-argument.com/) postulated by Nick Bostrom, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. More interesting though is the concept of illusory reality, i.e. reality is not as it appears. Even the objective realities we experience as a collective may be an illusion, but our intersubjective realities are certainly illusory. \\n\\nThese, as per Buddhist beliefs, are a primary cause of our suffering. Our expectations are shaped by these intersubjective realities and never truly match the objective or subjective realities. We continue to seek more but we are rarely ever content. Even when we are content, we assume that these intersubjective realities are permanent, granted to us by a foreign agency such as God or laws that are sacred and immortal as if they were ordained by nature and not by other humans who are subject to vagaries just like the rest of us. \\n\\nThis realization is like a [Red Pill that liberates you from the cycle of unnecessary suffering](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-17-the-red-pill-of-renunciation-embracing-reality-as-it-is/). The key difference from the Red Pill in the Matrix though is that you don\'t just take the Red Pill once, rather you have to take it multiple times throughout your life: each time you choose to either let your happiness be governed entirely by intersubjective realities or to take charge for your own happiness by seeing reality for it is."},{"id":"the-group-effect","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-group-effect","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-11-04-the-group-effect.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-04-the-group-effect.md","title":"The Group Effect","description":"We can never achieve things as individuals.

Think of particles in a gaseous substance. They are separate from each other because the binding forces are weak. When bound in a container, they bounce around and collide with each other at times. It\'s almost impossible to predict the velocity and position of each individual particle. However, when you think of the substance as a whole, it has some predictable properties that have been well-studied.\\n\\nLet\'s shift gears a little, still remaining within the physical realm. Now think about atoms in a [radioactive material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay). It is again almost impossible to predict when the individual atom will decay because the process is probabilistic. However, the rate of radioactive decay of the material as a whole is well-defined.\\n\\nAs suggested by Warren Weaver in his influential article [\\"Science and Complexity\\"](https://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf), science itself went through a paradigm shift as we studied data from many different individual phenomena and applied the law of large numbers to analyze this data to solve problems of disorganized complexity. This data is often distributed in some manner which gives us patterns to extrapolate and predict. An individual event is too random, but the predictions we can make based on the patterns we observe are more certain.\\n\\nEven from a sociological perspective, there are phenomena that help us understand this group effect better. An example that comes to mind is the \\"collective wisdom\\" phenomenon demonstrated by a study that journalist James Suroweicki describes in his book [\\"Wisdom of the Crowds\\",](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1636023205&sr=1-2) where a large number of people were able to predict the number of marbles in a jar when individual guesses tended to be way off.\\n\\nAn irony is that even as a lot of us may be aware of these group effects through our studies of the sciences, we see ourselves as just a little bit special than others. That is why we may see our lives are different and view them with a preferential bias that gets shattered when outlier events, termed as [black swan events by statistician Nassim Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) occur in our lives. As Daniel Kahneman points out in his book [\\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\",](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) even scientific researchers, whom you would generally hold to a higher standard, suffer from such systematic biases.\\n\\nThe reality, however, is that we are interdependent, interconnected. Despite our uniqueness, in the larger scheme of things, we are no more than a statistic. Each of our lives is thus of equal importance: no more, no less. This is best captured in the philosophy of [dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) that is central to all Schools of Buddhism - nothing exists in itself, but exists only in conjunction with others."},{"id":"producing-more-than-consuming","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/producing-more-than-consuming","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-10-20-producing-more-than-consuming.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-20-producing-more-than-consuming.md","title":"Producing more than consuming","description":"Just as industrialization had created physical consumer markets through surplus production of goods, digitalization has created digital consumer markets through surplus production of content.","date":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 20, 2021","tags":[{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"},{"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"}],"readingTime":3.785,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

The main difference is that digital media platforms have access to more data and sophisticated algorithms to better analyze insights from the data so that they can essentially \\"hack into your psychology\\". \\n\\nThis has become an even bigger problem [thanks to the pandemic](https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-digital-addiction-made-worse-covid-19) where people are cut off from each other due to social distancing and forced to spend more time at home, left to their digital devices. \\n\\nI have experienced this personally. I used to be wary of using social media longer than intended before I enrolled in college. However, in a bid to form connections as a college student, I ended up mindlessly following a lot of people on different social media platforms. In particular, as I started spending more time at home after the pandemic, I found myself becoming addicted to Twitter. \\n\\nTwitter seemed great as I had access to thoughts from different great minds on the planets via their Tweets. I also did not have to read news articles or watch the news channels - I could read the summaries on my Twitter feed instead. \\n\\nI only began to grasp the gravity of the problem after I lashed out at my parents in anger, for no fault of theirs. As I reflected upon the cause of my anger, I realized it was due to pent-up frustration - the frustration triggered by all the social justice-related Tweets I had read. \\n\\nI hadn\'t been doing great in school up till that point, but I ended up sinking more time into social media than I should have and this most certainly contributed to my grades tanking.  \\n\\nI can be impulsive, so once I read [a blog post written by Cal Newport that resonated with me](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/), I decided to deactivate most of my social media handles. This did help curb the addiction, but I soon realized that it wasn\'t a good long-term solution. I found a [better way to use social media](https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-make-social-media-work-for-you-part-i/): to share the essays I was writing through the #Ship30for30 challenge or on my blog. \\n\\nGoing on \\"social media lite\\" made me understand an important principle that seems to apply in other areas as well: limit consumption and increase production. You have to consume as you need to learn from others. However, when you switch to the productivity mode, you switch to a mindset of what value do you provide - giving more than you take. \\n\\nThat\'s why there is so much emphasis on productivity in the modern world. No matter what kind of work you do, you are providing some kind of value. You get paid precisely because you provide value. Your value increases when you focus on what you can give rather than what you receive in the form of benefits. \\n\\nEven if we leave aside the career aspect of productivity aside, I believe that channeling productivity, such as through [creativity, increases happiness](https://aaditkamat.github.io/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness) in the long run as it gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This comes in handy especially when you need to soldier through the challenges in life.\\n\\nThat is why the minimalist philosophy is so appealing. As you adopt this philosophy, you start to realize that you don\'t need too much to be happy. This allows you to step down from the hedonistic treadmill, which leaves you craving for more and more. \\n\\nWhilst the pandemic has been a major upheaval that left much destruction in its wake, it has also been a stark reminder of what truly matters: human connection and mental/physical wellbeing over materialistic wealth. Producing good work and sharing it with other people in the community who may benefit from it sparks true joy. Even when things don\'t turn out the way you expected, which happens more often than not, you feel contented as you have given your best, which is all you could have done under the circumstances.\\n\\nWe cannot unplug ourselves from the internet, but the best way we can make sense of all the information we are exposed to without becoming overwhelmed is to use it to create something of our own and share it with others.\\n\\n> Thank you to Manus Wong whose post on [how consumerism is killing our creativity](https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/) echoed my sentiments on the topic and in turn inspired this post."},{"id":"my-takeaways-from-chanakya-in-daily-life","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/my-takeaways-from-chanakya-in-daily-life","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-10-16-my-takeaways-from-chanakya-in-daily-life.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-16-my-takeaways-from-chanakya-in-daily-life.md","title":"My takeways from Chankya in Daily Life","description":"Just before writing this, I was leafing through some chapters","date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"},{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":4.385,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It has distilled the 6,000 sutras from\\n[Chanakya\'s Arthashastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra) that cover a wide range of topics (over 1, 000 by\\nthe author\'s estimation) into 3 components of life that are important\\nto everyone: personal, professional, and familial.\\n\\nThese are some of my takeaways from this book.\\n\\n## Writing a book\\n\\nA book is a major undertaking. It takes a minimum of 6 months to a year\\nof consistent writing once a rough outline is planned and a publisher\\nhas accepted the proposal. Adding on top of that the other demands to ensure good book sales such as marketing it through various channels,\\ngoing through several rounds of editing and discussion with the publisher\\nand reaching out to beta readers for feedback, makes the journey seem even more daunting.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s a journey worth undertaking because you are leaving something for posterity.\\nThe author cites the example of the Arthashastra. If Chanakya had not\\nwritten it, the future generations would have been left bereft of its wisdom.\\n\\nIf the idea of a book sounds impractical, it may help to maintain a diary\\nor a blog instead. The best time to write is at night as you can reflect\\nupon the happenings of the day. A month of journaling provides a lot of material\\nin itself. Over the span of a year, you may have enough writing to fit into a book.\\n\\nAn instance that springs to mind is the Diary of Anne Frank. The diary\\nwas a coping mechanism for a young girl who was trying to survive the atrocities\\nthat the Holocaust heaped upon her family and friend, as Jews in Nazi Germany.\\nIt not only bore testament to her indomitable spirit in the face of adversity,\\nbut also provided interesting insights into the psyche of a teenager.\\n\\nHer struggles would be relatable to a lot of people today, who have had to bear the\\nthe brunt of a surge of relentless lockdowns due to the current pandemic.\\n\\n## Listening to music\\n\\nMusic has the power to uplift your mood. In the past, kings would wake up to\\nthe sound of royal music. Chanakya himself took great pains to\\narrange the right kind of music, based on the king\'s moods. To do so,\\nhe sought counsel from some of the best music composers in the kingdom.\\n\\nNowadays, there are a plethora of playlists available thanks to streaming platforms\\nlike [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/browse), and \\n[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/). The key here is to be\\nmindful in curating a playlist for the day, keeping in mind the fluctuations\\nof mood over the course of the day.\\n\\nFor example, if you need to focus most intently during the morning, you should select soft music. Increase the intensity of the music\\nas the pace of work picks up.\\n\\n## Developing a creative hobby\\n\\nApart from work, it is important to cultivate at least one or two hobbies\\nthat keep you engaged. Without these, life can start to feel humdrum.\\n\\nThe best hobbies are the ones that involve some amount of creativity.\\nWriting, singing, dancing, cooking, and painting: all of these are creative\\nactivities because they allow you to freely express yourself.\\n\\nIt may even be worthwhile to do [creative workouts](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/5-Minute-Creative-Workouts-Get-Your-Creativity-in-Shape/483111042) once in a while to\\nshake things up. These allow you to put your \\"creative muscles\\" to work.\\nNothing is sadder than the demise of a creative hobby.\\n\\n## Taking a power nap\\n\\nWhile this may sound counterintuitive, sometimes taking a nap can be\\na major productivity boost. The best time of the day for such \\"power naps\\"\\nis the afternoon. It may be difficult to work those into your schedule, especially\\nif you are overloaded with work, but try to make time for such naps\\non occasion.\\n\\n## Finding a mentor\\n\\nIn this digital age, we have all the information from around the\\nglobe at our fingertips as they say. One can also find tons of \\"gurus\\"\\non social media platforms that seem to dispense good advice for free.\\n\\nThe main barrier though is what information you can trust. Another\\nconcern is that even information from trusted sources can be harmful, if\\nit is misinterpreted.\\n\\nHence, it is important to find mentors or guides in the areas of life\\nthat you wish to succeed. Before you seek them out though, you need\\nto ascertain first whether these areas are indeed truly important to you.\\n\\nThe author mentions his example to illustrate this point. Due to the lack of formal training material on Chanakya\'s Arthashastra, he had to reach out to a Sanskrit scholar from the [Chinmaya mission](https://www.chinmayamission.com/) who could educate him on the meaning of the different sutras. \\nThis has allowed the author to craft this book, as well as several others, based on the\\nteachings from the Arthashastra.\\n\\n--\\n\\nThe book covers over 70 topics, so there\'s a wealth of information\\nfor anyone and everyone. There are simple yet powerful principles\\nto design a fulfilling life. I hope that my takeaways inspire more people\\nto pick up this book right away."},{"id":"my-thoughts-on-the-matrix","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-matrix","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-10-10-my-thoughts-on-the-matrix.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-10-my-thoughts-on-the-matrix.md","title":"My thoughts on the Matrix","description":"I had watched \\"The Matrix\\" a couple of years ago.

That\'s why I thought that I would write up a blog post sharing some of my takeaways from the film.\\n\\n## About choice\\n\\nAt a surface level, it\'s a [dystopian science fiction film that discusses the existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeovers_in_popular_culture#1950s_and_earlier). However, at a deeper level, the movie talks about choice: the role humans can play in shaping their destinies.\\n\\nOne of the scenes that immediately pops up to the mind is the choice between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill that Neo has to make if he wants to truly understand the nature of the Matrix. However, there are several other small or big choices that Neo has to make: choosing to follow Trinity\'s instructions or searching for Morpheus on his own, choosing to believe that he is the \\"Chosen One\\" or not, choosing to risk his life to save Morpheus\'s life. \\n\\nThe freedom of choice is juxtaposed with the role of destiny. As Neo says to Morpheus, he does not believe in fate because that means that he does not have control over his life. This seems to apply pretty well to the world of the Matrix because it is meant to be deterministic but may not apply to the \\"real world\\". However, it highlights the human tendency to be proactive, as opposed to reactive, and try to expand their [circle of influence](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/980363-proactive-people-focus-their-efforts-in-the-circle-of-influence).\\n\\nOne of the characters, who goes by the alias \\"Mouse\\", has programmed a woman in a red dress to be sent out into the Matrix. She serves as a distraction, literally a red herring (hence the color red). The way I interpreted it, it seemed like a message that humans who choose to lead a focused life have to cull a lot of distractions along the way to reach their goal(s). This is especially true in this digital age where such distractions abound.\\n\\n## About Buddhism\\n\\nCentral to religions like Buddhism is the practice of meditation. There are several kinds of meditation exercises, but one of the most basic ones involves focussing intently on your breath. That\'s because it is a sure way of grounding you in the present moment. When Neo resists as he learns the truth about the Matrix and goes into a spiral, Morpheus asks him to breathe to stay calm. This is almost certainly a reference to the role of breath in staying grounded. It\'s also not a coincidence that Morpheus seems to spout a lot of Buddhist koan-like statements such as this one:\\n\\n> Neo: I thought it wasn\'t real \\n> Morpheus: Your mind makes it real\\n> Neo: If you\'re killed in the matrix, you die here?\\n> Morpheus: The body cannot live without the mind \\n\\n## About discovery\\n\\nWhen Trinity first meets Neo she says:\\n> It\'s the question that drives us, Neo...The answer is out there looking for you and it will find you if you want it to\\n\\nThis drives home the point about life being a process of search and discovery. Few of the truths we seek are objective, except perhaps those that we have stipulated and agreed upon as laws.\\n\\n## About belief \\n\\nNeo spends a lot of the time believing that he is not the \\"chosen One\\". However, when he\'s forced to choose between his life and Morpheus\'s life, he becomes much more decisive. He takes the reins of freeing Morpheus into his own hands. Even though he\'s faced by agents who are much stronger and faster than he is, Neo is able to free his mind from fear and other delusions to unlock his true potential. In doing so, he sees the Matrix as it truly is: computer code processing data in a mainframe. He is, therefore, able to thwart the attempts made by the Matrix to control him.\\n\\nThe sparring session between Morpheus and neo underscores the importance of belief even further:\\n\\n> Morpheus: How did I beat you?\\n> Neo: You... you\'re too fast.\\n> Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that\'s air you\'re breathing now?\\n\\n## About reality\\n\\nAs Morpheus is explaining the nature of the Matrix, he questions Neo:\\n> What is real? How do you define \'real\'? If you\'re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then \'real\' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.\\n\\nThis alludes to that our mind is a VR simulator in itself: we form perceptions about the world in front of us, based on what are actually electrical sensory inputs.\\n\\nThinking about the \\"real world\\" in this light, it doesn\'t seem absurd that Cerebro should wish to betray the other crew members and return to the Matrix. Is the outside world any less real than the world of the Matrix? It becomes a matter of perspective because you can hack your psychology to \\"Blue Pill\\" it away.\\n\\n## About Love\\n\\nDuring Neo\'s first meeting with the Oracle, she points to a banner and says:\\n> Do you know what means? It\'s Latin. It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.\\n\\nTrue love, just like success and happiness, is an aspiration that is hard to achieve. The more you go out of the way to find \\"true love\\", the more it seems to elude you. The best you can do is share your feelings with someone whom you truly find special. If you are lucky, you may find love on your first try. Often though, it takes trial and tribulations, rejections after rejections, before you find love. \\n\\nIn the end, you have to go with your gut because you can\'t decode the inner workings of your mind."},{"id":"encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-10-05-encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-05-encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests.md","title":"Encouraging kids to pursue their interests","description":"Kids usually have no idea about what they wish to pursue as a career growing up.

That\'s ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.\\n\\nThere are exceptions: the so called \\"prodigies\\". [Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson\'s study](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273) provides good grounds to study expert performance:\\n\\n> The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.\\n \\nHence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.\\n\\nThere are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:\\n1) \\"Nurture\\": Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain\\n    \\n2) \\"Nature\\": The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it\'s a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast\\n\\nThat\'s why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery. If you force them to pick something else to specialize in, they are likely to have some regret: \\"what if, instead, I had pursued something I was truly interested in\\"? \\n\\nTrevor Noah has expressed this sentiment beautifully in his book [\\"Born A Crime\\"](https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1633442048&sr=8-1):\\n\\n> We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d \u201cIf only\u2026\u201d \u201cI wonder what would have\u2026\u201d You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days\\n\\nWhen kids don\'t have any idea, any domain they choose to specialize is good because the only things stopping the kid are hard work and determination. It\'s unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.\\n\\nMost children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That\'s because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent\'s perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.\\n\\nIn the end, I believe it\'s a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take."},{"id":"creativity-leads-to-happiness","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-30-creativity-leads-to-happiness.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-30-creativity-leads-to-happiness.md","title":"Creativity leads to happiness","description":"In my previous blog post, I had discussed about how happiness is a measure of success.","date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 30, 2021","tags":[{"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"},{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":1.98,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I\'ll just share what I think.\\n\\nMy view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. \\n\\nOne of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. \\n\\nCreativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. \\n\\nCreativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. \\n\\nAs a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other\'s ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.\\n\\nA quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book [\\"A Man\'s Search For Meaning\\"](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI) is in order here: \\"In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.\\" \\n\\nCreative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it\'s this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life."},{"id":"happiness-is-success","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/happiness-is-success","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-23-happiness-is-success.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-23-happiness-is-success.md","title":"Happiness is success","description":"What our parents have taught us from a young is mostly true.

Hard work, determination\\nand focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn\\nto become successful.\\n\\nHowever, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions\\nour parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.\\nThere is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing\\ngoals and goals are largely individualistic.\\n\\nIt\'s not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it\'s important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make. \\nThis reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even\\nhaving an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.\\n\\nJust like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.\\n\\nAs you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. \\n\\nOf course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.\\n\\nThey act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don\'t get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. \\n\\nWith the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. [The only panacea to this information overload is to create](https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/). Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.\\n\\nWhen you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.\\n\\nThis is what I believe true success looks like.\\n\\n> Inspired by reading a Kindle sample of \\"Think Like A Monk\\" by Jay Shetty"},{"id":"embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-19-embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-19-embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity.md","title":"Embrace the messiness of creativity","description":"We often like to look at the end result and awe at the mastery involved in creating that result.

However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. \\n\\nInstead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by [analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann\'s Zettlekasten](https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/). It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like \\"behind the scenes\\".\\n\\nI\'ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I\'m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to \\"unlock\\" your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.\\n\\n## Learning\\nAs I\'ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. \\n\\nAs we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.\\n\\nWe may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.\\n\\nHence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is [interleaving](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf) that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.\\n\\nThis is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of \\"connecting the dots\\" in his [famous Stanford lecture](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/)\\n\\n## Conversing\\nIf that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.\\n\\nYou are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.\\n\\nIsn\'t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can\'t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that\'s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.\\n\\n## Coding\\n\\nI had learnt coding back in high school but didn\'t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn\'t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.\\n\\nHence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn\'t fit into that model. \\n            \\nCoding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That\'s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.\\n\\nYou are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.\\n\\nAt a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.\\n\\nUnless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren\'t going to harness the power of coding.\\n\\n## Exercising\\n\\nPhysical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. \\n\\nRather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, [HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711). This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.\\n\\nIt is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.\\n\\n## Writing\\n\\nWhen you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. \\n\\nYou can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. \\n\\nYou have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with [the process of rewriting](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html)\\n\\nEven that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That\'s a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAll the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the \\"focussed mode\\" of our brains comes into the picture.\\n\\nHowever, we need to embrace the \\"diffused mode\\" and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.\\n\\nEven the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.\\n\\nIt\'s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don\'t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I\'ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.\\n\\nCreativity in itself is an \\"emergent\\" phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results."},{"id":"its-ok-to-forget","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/its-ok-to-forget","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-11-its-okay-to-forget.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-11-its-okay-to-forget.md","title":"It\'s Ok To Forget","description":"Podcast link//freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/","date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 11, 2021","tags":[{"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"},{"label":"podcasts","permalink":"/blog/tags/podcasts"},{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":2.76,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.\\n\\nMy own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.\\n\\n## Forgetting curve\\n\\nThat is because our brain has a \\"forgetting curve\\" just as it has a \\"learning curve\\": you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.\\nThe dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.\\n\\n## The role of intention\\nYour brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. \\n\\nHowever, it\'s unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.\\n\\n## The importance of context\\nAngela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. \\n\\n## Much room for misinterpretation\\nIt is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. \\n\\nAs Stephen says towards the end, \\"My job is to write and the reader\'s job is to read and forget\\". In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work."},{"id":"deep-human-a-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/deep-human-a-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-05-deep-human-a-review.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-05-deep-human-a-review.md","title":"Deep Human - A Book Review","description":"Goodreads link//www.goodreads.com/book/show/52455951-deep-human","date":"2021-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 5, 2021","tags":[{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":6.71,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

This becomes self-evident as we observe the people around us during the commute, glued to their mobile devices and unaware of their surroundings. \\n\\nSecular mindfulness, the mindfulness techniques that are not specific to any particular religion, allow you to focus on the internal sensations of the body by observing them in a non-judgemental way.\\n\\nTo highlight the benefits of integrating mindfulness into your daily life, Crystal has shared the experiences of students that have taken CFG1010 who are aware of the overpowering influence of technology in their lives and how they became more attentive during the class after practising mindfulness techniques. A similar effect has been observed amongst employees who have attended group mindfulness sessions.\\n\\n## Skill 2: Self-Awareness\\nWithout self-awareness, we will not be able to regulate our emotions and understand why we behave the way we do. This can lead us to subconsciously get into negative patterns of thinking and live life on autopilot. Having great internal self-awareness allows us to have better control over the four main constituents of self: the mind, our body, our soul and spirituality. Internal self-awareness can be cultivated by practising mindfulness during different activities.\\n\\n## Skill 3: Empathy\\nEmpathy is what makes us human. It allows us to see the world from another\'s perspective. When we can apply this skill successfully in our careers and our life in general, the results are magical.\\n\\nThere are 3 modes of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.\\n\\n1. **Cognitive empathy**: Cognitive empathy means that we can understand what the other is going through but does not necessarily mean that we share this empathy. This can be employed successfully by manipulators to read you like a book and trick you into doing what they want. This need not always be used negatively though, as doctors for example can distance themselves from the pain that the patient is going through even as they understand it very precisely.\\n\\n2. **Emotional empathy**: Emotional empathy, on the other hand, means that we experience the same emotions that the other person is going through due to the \\"mirror neurons\\" in our brain. This is what causes us to wince in pain when we see someone hurting badly on the television, even as we are not going through the same pain ourselves.\\n\\n3. **Compassionate empathy**: Compassionate empathy takes this a step further, where we strongly feel that we should do all we can in our power to reduce the suffering of the other person.\\n\\n## Skill 4: Complex Communication\\nComplex Communication is required to give the right feedback to the people we work with. This involved conveying our emotional state as accurately as we can. It is complex because we are not always aware of the inner workings of the black box that is our mind, which is influenced by different moods due to different factors such as the time of the day, the weather and the events that have taken place up to the point. When it comes to others, this gets even worse because they are even harder to read. To master this skill, we need to tap on the other skills such as self-awareness and empathy.\\n\\nIn place of the \\"shit sandwich\\" model of giving feedback: negative feedback hidden within the layers of positive feedback, which may either downplay the negative feedback or seem facetious, the authors propose the SBIFI model: Situation, Behaviour, Impact, Future, In-Group.\\n\\n1. **Situation**: Focus on one specific situation to give feedback on rather than resort to generalities such as \\"you always\\" or \\"you never\\". In general, humans are not very good at multitasking and this applies to digesting critical feedback as well. That is why focusing on one specific situation is essential for communicating what went wrong or what could be improved in a way that the person receiving feedback can take concrete action on.\\n\\n2. **Behaviour**: Describe the person\'s behaviour as precisely as you can and mention that you felt that it was inappropriate for the situation. Do not include other people in this assessment by saying \\"All of us think that you should...\\" because what you feel may not apply universally. \\n\\n3. **Impact**: Let the person know the consequences of his actions on the behaviour of others.\\n\\n4. **Future**: Provide feedback in a way that helps the person reflect on ways he could improve.\\n\\n5. **In-Group**: Share the vision and mission of the organisation and how the work done by the person fits into it.\\n\\n## Skill 5: Adaptive Resilience\\nAdaptive Resilience is perhaps one of the most important. In life, you are likely to face a lot of challenges and your success in part depends on the ability to adapt to them as well as persist through them. \\n\\nTo explain this concept, Crystal invokes the idea of the \\"fixed\\" and \\"growth\\" mindset proposed by Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford. \\n\\nA fixed mindset leads you to believe that you cannot change and things will mostly remain as they are. This mindset can be developed due to a person\'s upbringing and personal circumstances.\\nA growth mindset, on the other hand, allows you to see the temporary nature of setbacks and work to learn and grow from them instead of resorting to learned helplessness. \\n\\nThis very much relates to the idea of growing your sphere of influence/control proposed by Stephen Covey in 7 Habits of Highly Successful People. A growth mindset may not help you succeed, as luck plays a huge role as well, but a fixed mindset is almost certain to lead to failure.\\n\\n## My takeaways\\nI had first come to know Crystal and Greg Lim Lange, when I had taken the CFG1010: Roots and Wings module during the first semester of my studies at NUS. I found it a nice detour from the regular course workload that I was taking as it was non-technical and introduced concepts that were quite novel. \\n\\nHowever, at the back of my mind, I harboured a notion that was prevalent amongst most other students in technical fields: what was needed to succeed and ultimately land the interviews that would get me my internships and my first job after college would be my technical skills and not the \\"soft skills\\". Hence, I could not appreciate the wisdom behind the ideas covered in the book (a compilation of the ideas also covered in the course).\\n\\nI have acquired a renewed taste in this book with each subsequent reading and this will most likely be the book that I will keep referring to at different stages of my career, to do a sort of rain check that will help me see where I am at and where I want to be. Through my own experiences, I have come to realise just how important the skills mentioned in the book truly are. \\n\\nAs famously said by Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who has been cited a couple of times in the book, \\"IQ Gets You Hired, EQ Gets You Promoted\\". These are, I believe, so important that you should seek a role where you can hone these skills if you can, even as a job applicant.\\n\\nIt\'s quite hard to appreciate the significance of these skills especially as an undergraduate student specializing in an academically rigorous technical field where much emphasis is still placed on the \\"hard skills\\". However, you can\'t just sustain with the \\"hard skills\\" because you need to work with others, manage your own emotions and also craft a productive lifestyle around your work in the long run."},{"id":"so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-a-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-a-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-09-02-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-02-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.md","title":"So Good They Can\'t Ignore You - A Book Review","description":"Goodreads link//www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you","date":"2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":4.365,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. \\n\\n## Rule #2: Build Skills\\nOn the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. \\n\\nTo build career capital, Cal describes the necessary \\"craftsman mindset\\". Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.\\n\\nTo build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. \\n\\nOf course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. \\n\\n## Rule #3: The Importance of Control\\nThrough this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. \\n\\nThe former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don\'t have a backup plan. \\n\\nThe second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don\'t know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it\'s likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. \\n\\n## Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission\\nAccording to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the \\"adjacent possible\\", a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.\\n\\n## Other important concepts\\nIn between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets. \\nAccording to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. \\n\\nWhen you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don\'t have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.\\n \\n## My takeaways\\n\\nWhat I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it\'s hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. \\n\\nI do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication."},{"id":"learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-08-28-learn-like-a-pro-book-review.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-28-learn-like-a-pro-book-review.md","title":"Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review","description":"Goodreads link//www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro","date":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 28, 2021","tags":[{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":4.145,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I had taken the popular MOOC \\"Learning How To Learn\\" taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn\'t fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. \\n\\nHere are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:\\n\\n## Increase focus the Pomodoro Way\\nWhen you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.\\n\\n## Get enough sleep\\nMake sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.\\n\\n## Seperate editing from writing\\nAs you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.\\n\\n## Make your learning active\\nTake steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.\\n\\n## Simulate the exam conditions\\nTake practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.\\n\\n## Exercise regularly and eat healthy\\nIt is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.\\n\\n## Follow the instructions\\nRead exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.\\n\\n## Interleave your studies\\nInterleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test\\n\\nMost, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works."},{"id":"writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-08-19-writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-19-writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system.md","title":"Writing as an external data processing system","description":"As I started to think more about writing online, I often wondered to myself about how people would write before the printing press was invented.

The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?\\n\\n\\nI found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled \\"Memory Overload\\". It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer\'s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.\\n\\n\\nHowever, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn\'t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. \\n\\n\\nHowever, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.\\n\\n\\nToday, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.\\n\\n\\nAs I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. \\n\\n\\nAs a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven\'t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.\\n\\n\\nThat, however, shouldn\'t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.\\n\\n\\nThis is how the audience becomes a part of the writer\'s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer\'s ideas."},{"id":"the-butterfly-effect","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-butterfly-effect","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-08-17-the-butterfly-effect copy.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-17-the-butterfly-effect copy.md","title":"The butterfly effect","description":"Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms.","date":"2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2021","tags":[{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":1.175,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.\\n\\n\\nParenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent\'s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.\\n\\n\\nHence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.\\n\\n\\nParents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children."},{"id":"is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-08-06-is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-06-is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary.md","title":"Is challenging the conventional wisdom always necessary?","description":"I was listening to a conversation between Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens, the creator of the popular YouTube channel VSauce, over the Lex Fridman podcast.

The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.\\n\\n\\nThis made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, \\"Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty\\". A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time."},{"id":"should-we-read-more-self-help-books","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/should-we-read-more-self-help-books","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-08-05-should-we-read-more-self-help-books.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-05-should-we-read-more-self-help-books.md","title":"Should we read more self help books?","description":"Self-help books generally encode principles that help you chart goals for your life.

The importance of habits have been discussed in a couple of other self-help books as well.

My full-time role as a QA Engineer requires me to sit down in front of my laptop and monitor for longer hours than I was used to as a student.

As a reward loop is essential for habit formation, you need to create an incentive after you have completed a workout.

That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.\\n\\nTo avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues.

Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.\\n\\nIt is hard to quantify happiness, since happiness is a state of the mind. Also, happiness is relative. You are likely to feel happier on days when your mood is uplifted or even normal as compared to days when you have gone through a rough patch.\\n\\nThere are different sources of happiness. Some find happiness in their work. Some find happiness through connecting with their loved ones. Others find happiness through gaining wealth and other materialistic possessions.\\n\\nIt is tempting to think that the happiest people are those that are the most wealthy. However, money can also be a source of stress. The rich are often unsure whether the friends they have are true friends or merely friends of their money. Studies measuring the happiness quotient also seem to indicate that happiness tends to increase with income levels but only uptil an inflection point, where the curve then tapers off.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the happiest people are the ones who are able to remain focussed on the present instead of worrying excessively about what the future holds or remaining stuck with the regrets of the past. They are able to manage their expectations realistically and maintain a healthy balance between their social and work lives."},{"id":"why-do-we-have-regrets","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-do-we-have-regrets","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-27-why-do-we-have-regrets.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-27-why-do-we-have-regrets.md","title":"Why do we have regrets?","description":"Youngsters like me are always on a look out for advice that can help us make the best use of our time and set ourselves up for the future.

To me, it seems quite natural for us humans to feel disappointed if things don\'t work out as well as expected, especially since opportunities abound in the modern world and there are multiple paths to success.

Hence, not everyone really works regular hours during a designated work week. Some employees are required to work on night shifts or alternate full day shifts, while others may have flexible working hours.\\n\\nHowever, as more industries are pivoting towards regular hours, it\'s important to ask this question: should companies revise their working schedules or continue to stick to the status quo? I believe that is it best if the management of a company can assess its own situation holistically and follow what works best for the organisation as a whole, rather than having to follow what is the agreed upon norm for the insustry. As demonstrated in the case of Iceland, where companies are moving toward four day work weeks, governments also have an important role to play. Going forward, this will be seen as an essential component of employee welfare. There isn\'t a one size fits all approach to this dilemma, but an approach that adapts as per the demands of different roles. Companies will need to find workarounds that preserve the integrity of the organisation if different groups of employees have different working hours."},{"id":"rising-up-after-failure","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rising-up-after-failure","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-25-rising-up-after-failure.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-25-rising-up-after-failure.md","title":"Rising up after failure","description":"This afternoon, as I was watching the videos for a React Native course on Udemy, I came across an image that I found quite inspirational.

Tapping into insights from neuroscience can help you undo those habits that do not benefit you and create new ones that will help enrich your life. The actions required to carry out these tasks, no matter how complex, get recorded in a region of our long-term memory known as the Basal Ganglia. As a result, we can fetch the information required for these tasks effortlessly from our brain. \\n\\nOne of the key elements of developing any habit is practice. For the actions to be stored in our memory effectively, we need to be able to repeat them a sufficient number of times. Another important element of developing a habit is to create a positive reward loop around it. Thinking of how the habit fits into the long term picture will help you stick with it when the going gets tough. Last but not the least, have a plan of action for how you will go about forming the habit and what you will do if that does not work out. This will also help build up the resilience that is needed for habit formation."},{"id":"inculcating-a-reading-habit","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/inculcating-a-reading-habit","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-23-inculcating-a-reading-habit.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-23-inculcating-a-reading-habit.md","title":"Inculcating a reading habit","description":"Since high school, I have fallen behind on my reading habit.

While reading up on topics that you have expertise in will benefit you from a career perspective, it can also be illuminating to read works from other areas. For example, a lot of people like to read self help books. These often emphasize timeless principles that can be applied to different areas of your life to improve them. Some of the self-help books that I look forward to reading are Deep Work and Digital Minimalism, both written by Cal Newport as well as Atomic Habits by James Clear.\\n\\nReading, however, becomes effective only if you can apply those key ideas to enrich your life.

Like most statements of this nature, this is also a tantalizing generalization. It\'s not that surprising though, to see people of the older generation bemoan this apparent truth. Technological progress has indeed widened the gulf between the generations. The whole new world of opportunities afforded to us has made us impatient for results. \\n\\nWhy then is patience so important, especially in these times? This is because the goals we strive to attain for are mostly long term. Whether its\' a good home, a loving family or stable financial wealth we are talking about, success don\'t come about in a jiffy. Being cliched here, but it takes blood, sweat and tears to build all of these.\\n\\nThis is the ethic that our parents have been trying inculcate since young, and it\'s often when you truly mature that you realize why they have been doing so. When you invest in key areas of growth in your life, you cannot always expect quick returns. You have to wait, often for a long period of time, before you see your investments bearing fruit.

If the day shapes out to be haphazard, it will eventually impact the quality of my life.\\n\\n\\nOut of curiosity, I looked up Cal Newport\'s daily routine recently. The reason I did so is that I\'m impressed with all the work he has done outside his full-time job as a Computer Science professor, which in itself is a demanding job. \\n\\nAs a result, I came upon a website called mymorningroutine.com. This website provides transcripts of conversations that the team behind the My Morning Routine magazine had with about 343 professionals who have achieved success in their respective endeavours, from writing to entrepreneurship. \\n\\nIt would be fallacious to say that all of these individuals owe their success primarily to their morning routines, as that is inferring causation from correlation. However, reading through some of these interviews has reinforced my belief that a routine, as boring as it sounds, is indeed an ingredient for success."},{"id":"learning-how-to-learn","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learning-how-to-learn","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-19-learning-how-to-learn.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-19-learning-how-to-learn.md","title":"Learning How To Learn","description":"This morning, I started reading a book called \\"Learn Like A Pro\\" by Barbara Oakley.

Even when it seems like a task takes variable amounts of time to complete, I\'d highly suggest sticking to this technique. \\n\\nThis is because 25 minutes is the perfect amount of time to maintain focus on the task, and completing a Pomodoro gives your brain that dopamine boost it needs to stay motivated, especially if the task at hand is arduous. \\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Pomodoro technique is that it allows you to schedule breaks in between your work. Taking breaks is important for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it forages all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode where it can make connections between disparate strands of information to give you a higher-level picture, or a mental model, based on that information.\\n\\nEven as I have graduated from college, I have come to realise that it\'s important for me to improve my learning performance.

In such cases, the brain works in the background even as the human body is carrying out other tasks not remotely connected to the field of thought that the brain is pursuing.\\n\\nWhen you are working on any long term project, you are bound to go through stretches of boredom followed by periods of insight. Trying to tackle the boredom by switching to another window to catch up on email, Slack notifications or the social media feed leaves the brain with insufficient time to think about the problems that we wish to solve.

In view of these issues, the efforts made by governments to tackle population growth such as China\'s former one-child policy and the two-child policy now being promoted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India seem more than welcome.\\n\\nWatching a Kurzgesagt video on overpopulation however, changed my perspective on it. Instead of focussing on the doom and gloom that is generally associated with a burgeoning population, the video addressed the trends in demographic transition that have emerged in developing countries like Bangladesh, which mirror those that had been seen in the now-developed countries like Britain post-industrialisation. \\n\\nDue to improvements in healthcare, growing life spans and more educated citizens, the birth rates have started to decline and the population growth has more or less stabilised.

As history goes, different forms of money have evolved from the barter system where one person, the buyer, offers goods or services to the other person, the seller in return for goods or services of equivalent value. \\n\\nFor such a system to succeed, there are two key requirements that must be met. First, both parties involved must be fairly acquainted with each other for the exchange to take place. Second, the exchange must mutually benefit them in a way that they perceive as being of equivalent value. \\n\\nAs one can see, such a system quickly becomes cumbersome and unsustainable over time. Hence, it was necessary for humans to come up with a replacement that would allow people to transact without having these two key requirements in place.\\n\\nToday, money plays that role since the buyer does not need to provide anything of material value to the seller apart from monetary payment. In return the buyer is expected to participate in the economy through some way, typically through the employment, where he ends up providing a valuable good or service to others in the company in which he is employed or to consumers directly if he is self-employed. \\n\\nThere are exceptions to this rule, but the engine of modern economy treads forward when the balance is maintained, as the supply meets the demand."},{"id":"stop-comparing-yourself-with-others","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/stop-comparing-yourself-with-others","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-10-stop-comparing-yourself-with-others.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-10-stop-comparing-yourself-with-others.md","title":"Stop comparing yourself with others","description":"As I have had issues with self-confidence and compared myself with others, I was naturally drawn towards this question: Is comparison always a negative tendency?","date":"2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 10, 2021","tags":[{"label":"personal growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-growth"}],"readingTime":1.215,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Angela said that it is important to evaluate the tendency to compare from an evolutionary psychology standpoint. \\n\\nHumans tend to compare their lives with lives of those who seem to be doing better because they wish to improve their lives. This is known as upward social comparison. This can be positive if the person does not get discouraged by others\' accomplishments, but tends to have detrimental effects on the person\'s mental health if done too often.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, a person may also experience schadenfreude, taking joy at someone\'s suffering. This is an example of downward social comparison. It rarely brings any benefit, since it does not improve the person\'s own wellbeing and may make the person feel guilty for experiencing such emotions instead.\\n\\n\\nI would conclude by saying that everyone needs to introspect and control this tendency if it is harming them. This is easier said than done, but you can only grow as a person if you seek to improve by competing with yourself, not with others."},{"id":"advice-to-my-former-self","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/advice-to-my-former-self","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-07-09-advice-to-my-former-self.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-09-advice-to-my-former-self.md","title":"What you should know as an undergraduate student - advice to my former self","description":"There comes a time after a student graduates where he reflects back upon his journey through the undergraduate days, usually right after his graduation.

As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I\'d instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they\'d likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.\\n\\n\\nSecond, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.\\n\\n\\nThird, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.\\n\\n\\nLast, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual\'s perspective.

I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn\u2019t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. \\n\\nReflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn\u2019t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I\u2019d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.\\n\\nAfter giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). \\n\\nI had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. \\n\\nAdmittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. \\n\\nThe admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn\u2019t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. \\n\\nI didn\u2019t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.\\n\\nOne of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn\u2019t need to spend the time doing that before college. \\n\\nI\u2019d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.\\n\\nEven though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the \u201csink or swim\u201d methodology used to teach such courses there. \\n\\nOf course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren\u2019t running an \u201cApple Genius Bar\u201d service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. \\n\\nThis would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.\\n\\nI haven\u2019t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through [Ali Spittel\u2019s tips to beginners](https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/), as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer."},{"id":"getting-my-moderna-shots","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/getting-my-moderna-shots","editUrl":"https://github.com/aaditkamat/aaditkamat/blog/2021-06-20-getting-my-moderna-shots.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-20-getting-my-moderna-shots.md","title":"Getting My Moderna Shots","description":"It was announced on 11th June in Singapore that [those in the age group of","date":"2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 20, 2021","tags":[{"label":"covid-19","permalink":"/blog/tags/covid-19"},{"label":"vaccines","permalink":"/blog/tags/vaccines"}],"readingTime":3.335,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Aadit Kamat","title":"Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to \\nprovide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at \\none of the [clinics or vaccination centers](https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs) for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have \\nbeen given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to \\nreceive this SMS.\\n\\nAnother thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for \\nbooking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I \\nbelieve that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered \\nto the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer \\nvaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly \\n[higher efficacy](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/) and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown [milder side-effects](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna).\\n\\nHowever, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the \\nModerna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as \\ncompared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting \\nmy shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore \\nGovernment is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to \\nget their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the \\npopulation vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up, \\nas evidenced by examples of [other developed nations reopening, \\nparticularly in the West](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious).\\n\\nI\'m glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination. \\nThankfully, I did not experience any of the [symptoms mentioned in the \\ninformation sheet](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf), so I left immediately after the observation period was over. \\n\\nUpon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also \\nreceived two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my \\nfamily has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they \\nwere being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise \\ncaution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from \\nthe Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.\\n\\nI would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug \\nallergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about \\nwhether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug \\nallergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with \\nthe ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice: \\n[Moderna](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf) or [Pfizer](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf). Rest assured, you will be asked the required \\nquestions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well \\nas before you take the vaccine.\\n\\nBefore you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it\'s easier to roll them up as you get your shot.\\n\\nWith this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the [COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs).\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, I\'m feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab."}]}')}}]);
