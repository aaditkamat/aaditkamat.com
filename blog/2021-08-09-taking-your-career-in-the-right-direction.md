In modern societies, humans spend a large amount of their time at work. By rough estimates, a human on average spends 80,000 hours in his or her career. That's a very long time.

One of the major reasons that humans have to work is that they need to earn a livelihood. Another equally important reason, however, is that solving any problem of significant magnitude requires a considerable amount of investment of resources like time and money that only groups can pool together.

Armed with this knowledge, it makes sense to pick a career that is likely to create the most impact. This is the idea behind the 80000 hours initiative affiliated with the Centre of Effective Altruism at the University of Oxford. 

Unfortunately, people do not always have the freedom to choose the career that is best aligned with their goals. One of the reasons can be barriers to entry for a profession. But another more fundamental reason is perhaps the lack of financial freedom. 

It seems as though society values money a lot, even though time may actually be even more precious than money because it is a non-renewable resource. That is why it is important to take the decision about your career path seriously. 

That said, the best career path need not necessarily be a straight line. There is a TED talk that I came across recently which discusses the same idea. The speakers Sarah Ellis and Hellen Tupper challenge the conventional wisdom that you need to climb the career ladder to achieve success in your profession. Hence, a career needs to be evaluated from a different perspective in modern times.
