Youngsters like me are always on a look out for advice that can help us make the best use of our time and set ourselves up for the future. Advice from elders are usually packed with insights. They wish to convey information that they think is important for us youngsters to know. This way we don't have to reinvent the wheel and go through the same struggles they did.

Sometimes, I also find a tinge of regret hidden in the advice. The alternate paths they could have taken but did not, either due to their own inhibitions or due to the circumstances, are often the cause for this regret.

As a result, I posed myself this question: Why do we have regrets? To me, it seems quite natural for us humans to feel disappointed if things don't work out as well as expected, especially since opportunities abound in the modern world and there are multiple paths to success. In such a case, doing a cost benefit analysis to prune out unfavourable paths seems like a pragmatic approach that also makes you feel more empowered.

However, it is infeasible to attach an opportunity cost to each decision. It fools you into boiling down life into an accountancy game, whereas life is complex.

This line of reasoning may help you rationalize your regrets: with the resources and knowledge available at the time, the decisions you took were the best you could have taken. It is easy to connect the dots in hindsight, but that's due to our hindsight bias.
