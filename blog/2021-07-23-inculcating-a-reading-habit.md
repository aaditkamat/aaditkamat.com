Since high school, I have fallen behind on my reading habit. After graduating from college though, I've come to realize that it is important to inculcate a reading habit.

Reading exposes you to the ideas espoused by different authors. While reading up on topics that you have expertise in will benefit you from a career perspective, it can also be illuminating to read works from other areas. For example, a lot of people like to read self help books. These often emphasize timeless principles that can be applied to different areas of your life to improve them. Some of the self-help books that I look forward to reading are Deep Work and Digital Minimalism, both written by Cal Newport as well as Atomic Habits by James Clear.

Reading, however, becomes effective only if you can apply those key ideas to enrich your life. That is how you actively learn from the material, like you would when you read the course materials for your examinations. The key difference is that you are aiming for a different long term goal: self-improvement.

Reading is also important for aspiring writers, because it allows them to generate the ideas they need to convert into writing. A handy tip that I have come across is that you need to strike a balance between how much you consume and how much your produce, with a good rule of thumb being that the time spent on the former does not exceed the time spent on the latter, especially as you are starting out.
