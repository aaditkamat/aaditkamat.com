Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack & Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.

As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.

Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.

You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That's where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.

To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.
