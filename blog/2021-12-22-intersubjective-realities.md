In Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari decodes one of the major reasons that humans have been able to "rule the world" - the ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, forming communities that believe in shared intersubjective realities. 

To the best of our knowledge, other animals live in dual realities, objective and subjective. Objective realities are those that exist independent of our individual sensations and experiences (e.g. physical forces that have existed since the creation of the universe) while subjective realities arise from individual sensations and experiences (e.g. emotions like pain, anger, and love that feel real but cannot be detected by others). They do not believe in abstract concepts like God, Money, and the Economy. 

Our might as a species does not stem from individual intelligence or extraordinary toolmaking capabilities. If so we could have conquered the world much earlier, as an average Homo Sapiens in a hunter-gatherer band was more skilled than an average Homo Sapiens in the modern era. 
Instead, it is due to increasingly sophisticated mechanisms of large-scale collaborations, made by possible a web of intersubjective realities, that have transformed us from those who sharpen flintstones to those who can now travel in space and dream of conquering other civilizations.

Many philosophical texts have alluded to the concept of [reality as an illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis#Origins). A popular proposal that explores this concept further is the ["Simulation Hypothesis"](https://www.simulation-argument.com/) postulated by Nick Bostrom, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. More interesting though is the concept of illusory reality, i.e. reality is not as it appears. Even the objective realities we experience as a collective may be an illusion, but our intersubjective realities are certainly illusory. 

These, as per Buddhist beliefs, are a primary cause of our suffering. Our expectations are shaped by these intersubjective realities and never truly match the objective or subjective realities. We continue to seek more but we are rarely ever content. Even when we are content, we assume that these intersubjective realities are permanent, granted to us by a foreign agency such as God or laws that are sacred and immortal as if they were ordained by nature and not by other humans who are subject to vagaries just like the rest of us. 

This realization is like a [Red Pill that liberates you from the cycle of unnecessary suffering](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-17-the-red-pill-of-renunciation-embracing-reality-as-it-is/). The key difference from the Red Pill in the Matrix though is that you don't just take the Red Pill once, rather you have to take it multiple times throughout your life: each time you choose to either let your happiness be governed entirely by intersubjective realities or to take charge for your own happiness by seeing reality for it is.
