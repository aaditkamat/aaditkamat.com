Every now and then, I love coming back to it and hope that I will do so even more in the future.</p><p>This meditation teaches you the power of selfless, unconditional love. The practice of unconditional love appears in a lot of ancient traditions and cultures around the world.

This happens often when I explore the dark side of humanity, especially as it is depicted in some forms of media. </p><p>In the media, human drama appears to emphasize both the positive and negative sides of human behaviour, often not in conjunction but rather separately. Therefore, we end up focusing on only one side, rather than seeing both sides equally, as we would if we observed human behaviour daily. </p><p>We also tend to focus more on the negative side of things because of our <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/negativity-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">negativity bias</a>, where as many as <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five positive experiences may be required to overcome the effects of one negative experience</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.prismic.io/thedecisionlab/da54d547-18f1-4442-b977-59ab514d3d5c_Negativity+bias.jpg?auto=compress,format" width="700px" alt="Negativity bias comic" class="img_E7b_"><figcaption align="center"> Negativity Bias </figcaption></figure><p>At some point though, even these positive and negative labels do not suffice to describe human experiences. It employs a <a href="https://medium.com/@JayBeDreamin/the-dangers-of-binary-thinking-why-context-matters-f69fe1f4a2e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binary mode of thinking</a> as a heuristic to simplify a complex world.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvTK3d-haDV8oD60JrmZDA.png" alt="Binary thinking" class="img_E7b_"><figcaption align="center"> Binary Thinking </figcaption></figure><p>First, there is some degree of subjectivity involved in evaluating experiences this way, as what appears positive to one may appear negative to another and vice versa. Second, there is a major chunk of human experiences that simply cannot be categorised this way.</p><p>Take for instance a person travelling on a bus or a train. If the person is enjoying themselves having a conversation with another, they can label that experience as positive. On the other hand, if they get into an altercation with the person during that conversation, they can label that experience as negative. But what about all the time spent in between where the person is not engaged in one thing or the other? Both the labels do not suffice to categorize such an experience. </p><p>On an individual level, therefore, taking stock of your <a href="https://lifedesignlog.com/rose-thorn-bud-activity-for-group-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roses, thorns and buds</a> helps you analyse your experiences on a spectrum.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lifedesignlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rose-thorn-bud-activity-descriptions.png" class="img_E7b_"><figcaption align="center"> Rose, Thorn &amp; Bud </figcaption></figure><p>Contrasted with the destructive feeling of misanthropy is the feeling of unconditional love that I find myself gravitating towards more strongly. I feel that it holds greater power and leaves you with a more lasting feeling of contentedness, even if it is just as temporal as all other feelings are. </p><p>This meditation teaches you how to practice unconditional love by thinking of it as <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanding your circle of moral compassion</a>.

Objective realities are those that exist independent of our individual sensations and experiences (e.g. physical forces that have existed since the creation of the universe) while subjective realities arise from individual sensations and experiences (e.g. emotions like pain, anger, and love that feel real but cannot be detected by others). They do not believe in abstract concepts like God, Money, and the Economy. </p><p>Our might as a species does not stem from individual intelligence or extraordinary toolmaking capabilities. If so we could have conquered the world much earlier, as an average Homo Sapiens in a hunter-gatherer band was more skilled than an average Homo Sapiens in the modern era.
Instead, it is due to increasingly sophisticated mechanisms of large-scale collaborations, made by possible a web of intersubjective realities, that have transformed us from those who sharpen flintstones to those who can now travel in space and dream of conquering other civilizations.</p><p>Many philosophical texts have alluded to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis#Origins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reality as an illusion</a>. A popular proposal that explores this concept further is the <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Simulation Hypothesis&quot;</a> postulated by Nick Bostrom, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. More interesting though is the concept of illusory reality, i.e. reality is not as it appears. Even the objective realities we experience as a collective may be an illusion, but our intersubjective realities are certainly illusory. </p><p>These, as per Buddhist beliefs, are a primary cause of our suffering. Our expectations are shaped by these intersubjective realities and never truly match the objective or subjective realities. We continue to seek more but we are rarely ever content. Even when we are content, we assume that these intersubjective realities are permanent, granted to us by a foreign agency such as God or laws that are sacred and immortal as if they were ordained by nature and not by other humans who are subject to vagaries just like the rest of us. </p><p>This realization is like a <a href="https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-17-the-red-pill-of-renunciation-embracing-reality-as-it-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Pill that liberates you from the cycle of unnecessary suffering</a>. The key difference from the Red Pill in the Matrix though is that you don&#x27;t just take the Red Pill once, rather you have to take it multiple times throughout your life: each time you choose to either let your happiness be governed entirely by intersubjective realities or to take charge for your own happiness by seeing reality for it is.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/the-group-effect">The Group Effect</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 4, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Individuals in themselves are too erratic - they experience much change over their lifetimes, they have underlying motivations that are too complex, their minds waver too much.</p><p>I feel that the analogies from physics provide good abstractions to understand chaos at an individual level. Think of particles in a gaseous substance. They are separate from each other because the binding forces are weak. When bound in a container, they bounce around and collide with each other at times. It&#x27;s almost impossible to predict the velocity and position of each individual particle. However, when you think of the substance as a whole, it has some predictable properties that have been well-studied.</p><p>Let&#x27;s shift gears a little, still remaining within the physical realm. Now think about atoms in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radioactive material</a>. It is again almost impossible to predict when the individual atom will decay because the process is probabilistic. However, the rate of radioactive decay of the material as a whole is well-defined.</p><p>As suggested by Warren Weaver in his influential article <a href="https://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Science and Complexity&quot;</a>, science itself went through a paradigm shift as we studied data from many different individual phenomena and applied the law of large numbers to analyze this data to solve problems of disorganized complexity. This data is often distributed in some manner which gives us patterns to extrapolate and predict. An individual event is too random, but the predictions we can make based on the patterns we observe are more certain.</p><p>Even from a sociological perspective, there are phenomena that help us understand this group effect better. An example that comes to mind is the &quot;collective wisdom&quot; phenomenon demonstrated by a study that journalist James Suroweicki describes in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1636023205&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Wisdom of the Crowds&quot;,</a> where a large number of people were able to predict the number of marbles in a jar when individual guesses tended to be way off.</p><p>An irony is that even as a lot of us may be aware of these group effects through our studies of the sciences, we see ourselves as just a little bit special than others. That is why we may see our lives are different and view them with a preferential bias that gets shattered when outlier events, termed as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black swan events by statistician Nassim Taleb</a> occur in our lives.

The main difference is that digital media platforms have access to more data and sophisticated algorithms to better analyze insights from the data so that they can essentially &quot;hack into your psychology&quot;. </p><p>This has become an even bigger problem <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-digital-addiction-made-worse-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to the pandemic</a> where people are cut off from each other due to social distancing and forced to spend more time at home, left to their digital devices. </p><p>I have experienced this personally. I used to be wary of using social media longer than intended before I enrolled in college. However, in a bid to form connections as a college student, I ended up mindlessly following a lot of people on different social media platforms. In particular, as I started spending more time at home after the pandemic, I found myself becoming addicted to Twitter. </p><p>Twitter seemed great as I had access to thoughts from different great minds on the planets via their Tweets. I also did not have to read news articles or watch the news channels - I could read the summaries on my Twitter feed instead. </p><p>I only began to grasp the gravity of the problem after I lashed out at my parents in anger, for no fault of theirs. As I reflected upon the cause of my anger, I realized it was due to pent-up frustration - the frustration triggered by all the social justice-related Tweets I had read. </p><p>I hadn&#x27;t been doing great in school up till that point, but I ended up sinking more time into social media than I should have and this most certainly contributed to my grades tanking.  </p><p>I can be impulsive, so once I read <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post written by Cal Newport that resonated with me</a>, I decided to deactivate most of my social media handles. This did help curb the addiction, but I soon realized that it wasn&#x27;t a good long-term solution. I found a <a href="https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-make-social-media-work-for-you-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better way to use social media</a>: to share the essays I was writing through the #Ship30for30 challenge or on my blog. </p><p>Going on &quot;social media lite&quot; made me understand an important principle that seems to apply in other areas as well: limit consumption and increase production. You have to consume as you need to learn from others. However, when you switch to the productivity mode, you switch to a mindset of what value do you provide - giving more than you take. </p><p>That&#x27;s why there is so much emphasis on productivity in the modern world. No matter what kind of work you do, you are providing some kind of value. You get paid precisely because you provide value. Your value increases when you focus on what you can give rather than what you receive in the form of benefits. </p><p>Even if we leave aside the career aspect of productivity aside, I believe that channeling productivity, such as through <a href="https://aaditkamat.github.io/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creativity, increases happiness</a> in the long run as it gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This comes in handy especially when you need to soldier through the challenges in life.</p><p>That is why the minimalist philosophy is so appealing. As you adopt this philosophy, you start to realize that you don&#x27;t need too much to be happy. This allows you to step down from the hedonistic treadmill, which leaves you craving for more and more. </p><p>Whilst the pandemic has been a major upheaval that left much destruction in its wake, it has also been a stark reminder of what truly matters: human connection and mental/physical wellbeing over materialistic wealth. Producing good work and sharing it with other people in the community who may benefit from it sparks true joy. Even when things don&#x27;t turn out the way you expected, which happens more often than not, you feel contented as you have given your best, which is all you could have done under the circumstances.</p><p>We cannot unplug ourselves from the internet, but the best way we can make sense of all the information we are exposed to without becoming overwhelmed is to use it to create something of our own and share it with others.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you to Manus Wong whose post on <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how consumerism is killing our creativity</a> echoed my sentiments on the topic and in turn inspired this post.</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/my-takeaways-from-chanakya-in-daily-life">My takeways from Chankya in Daily Life</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 16, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just before writing this, I was leafing through some chapters
of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chanakya-Daily-Life-Radhakrishnan-Pillai/dp/8129144441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Chanakya in Daily Life&quot; by Radhakrishnan Pillai</a>.
This is one of the books that I instinctively know that I would keep coming back to over the years. It has distilled the 6,000 sutras from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra</a> that cover a wide range of topics (over 1, 000 by
the author&#x27;s estimation) into 3 components of life that are important
to everyone: personal, professional, and familial.</p><p>These are some of my takeaways from this book.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="writing-a-book">Writing a book<a class="hash-link" href="#writing-a-book" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>A book is a major undertaking. It takes a minimum of 6 months to a year
of consistent writing once a rough outline is planned and a publisher
has accepted the proposal. Adding on top of that the other demands to ensure good book sales such as marketing it through various channels,
going through several rounds of editing and discussion with the publisher
and reaching out to beta readers for feedback, makes the journey seem even more daunting.</p><p>However, it&#x27;s a journey worth undertaking because you are leaving something for posterity.
The author cites the example of the Arthashastra. If Chanakya had not
written it, the future generations would have been left bereft of its wisdom.</p><p>If the idea of a book sounds impractical, it may help to maintain a diary
or a blog instead. The best time to write is at night as you can reflect
upon the happenings of the day. A month of journaling provides a lot of material
in itself. Over the span of a year, you may have enough writing to fit into a book.</p><p>An instance that springs to mind is the Diary of Anne Frank. The diary
was a coping mechanism for a young girl who was trying to survive the atrocities
that the Holocaust heaped upon her family and friend, as Jews in Nazi Germany.
It not only bore testament to her indomitable spirit in the face of adversity,
but also provided interesting insights into the psyche of a teenager.</p><p>Her struggles would be relatable to a lot of people today, who have had to bear the
the brunt of a surge of relentless lockdowns due to the current pandemic.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="listening-to-music">Listening to music<a class="hash-link" href="#listening-to-music" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>Music has the power to uplift your mood. In the past, kings would wake up to
the sound of royal music. Chanakya himself took great pains to
arrange the right kind of music, based on the king&#x27;s moods. To do so,
he sought counsel from some of the best music composers in the kingdom.</p><p>Nowadays, there are a plethora of playlists available thanks to streaming platforms
like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/browse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>, and
<a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Music</a>. The key here is to be
mindful in curating a playlist for the day, keeping in mind the fluctuations
of mood over the course of the day.</p><p>For example, if you need to focus most intently during the morning, you should select soft music. Increase the intensity of the music
as the pace of work picks up.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="developing-a-creative-hobby">Developing a creative hobby<a class="hash-link" href="#developing-a-creative-hobby" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>Apart from work, it is important to cultivate at least one or two hobbies
that keep you engaged. Without these, life can start to feel humdrum.</p><p>The best hobbies are the ones that involve some amount of creativity.
Writing, singing, dancing, cooking, and painting: all of these are creative
activities because they allow you to freely express yourself.</p><p>It may even be worthwhile to do <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/5-Minute-Creative-Workouts-Get-Your-Creativity-in-Shape/483111042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative workouts</a> once in a while to
shake things up. These allow you to put your &quot;creative muscles&quot; to work.
Nothing is sadder than the demise of a creative hobby.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="taking-a-power-nap">Taking a power nap<a class="hash-link" href="#taking-a-power-nap" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>While this may sound counterintuitive, sometimes taking a nap can be
a major productivity boost. The best time of the day for such &quot;power naps&quot;
is the afternoon. It may be difficult to work those into your schedule, especially
if you are overloaded with work, but try to make time for such naps
on occasion.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="finding-a-mentor">Finding a mentor<a class="hash-link" href="#finding-a-mentor" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>In this digital age, we have all the information from around the
globe at our fingertips as they say. One can also find tons of &quot;gurus&quot;
on social media platforms that seem to dispense good advice for free.</p><p>The main barrier though is what information you can trust. Another
concern is that even information from trusted sources can be harmful, if
it is misinterpreted.</p><p>Hence, it is important to find mentors or guides in the areas of life
that you wish to succeed. Before you seek them out though, you need
to ascertain first whether these areas are indeed truly important to you.</p><p>The author mentions his example to illustrate this point. Due to the lack of formal training material on Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra, he had to reach out to a Sanskrit scholar from the <a href="https://www.chinmayamission.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinmaya mission</a> who could educate him on the meaning of the different sutras.
This has allowed the author to craft this book, as well as several others, based on the
teachings from the Arthashastra.</p><p>--</p><p>The book covers over 70 topics, so there&#x27;s a wealth of information
for anyone and everyone. There are simple yet powerful principles
to design a fulfilling life. I hope that my takeaways inspire more people
to pick up this book right away.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-matrix">My thoughts on the Matrix</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-10-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 10, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I enjoyed watching it, but I could not appreciate the inherently philosophical nature of the movie. A close friend of mine who had watched it recently suggested that I rewatch it as he believed that I would be able to glean new insights from the film. And indeed, I could not help but marvel at its beauty. It feels as though each line from the film has some nugget of wisdom hidden in it. That&#x27;s why I thought that I would write up a blog post sharing some of my takeaways from the film.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-choice">About choice<a class="hash-link" href="#about-choice" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>At a surface level, it&#x27;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeovers_in_popular_culture#1950s_and_earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dystopian science fiction film that discusses the existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence</a>. However, at a deeper level, the movie talks about choice: the role humans can play in shaping their destinies.</p><p>One of the scenes that immediately pops up to the mind is the choice between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill that Neo has to make if he wants to truly understand the nature of the Matrix. However, there are several other small or big choices that Neo has to make: choosing to follow Trinity&#x27;s instructions or searching for Morpheus on his own, choosing to believe that he is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; or not, choosing to risk his life to save Morpheus&#x27;s life. </p><p>The freedom of choice is juxtaposed with the role of destiny. As Neo says to Morpheus, he does not believe in fate because that means that he does not have control over his life. This seems to apply pretty well to the world of the Matrix because it is meant to be deterministic but may not apply to the &quot;real world&quot;. However, it highlights the human tendency to be proactive, as opposed to reactive, and try to expand their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/980363-proactive-people-focus-their-efforts-in-the-circle-of-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circle of influence</a>.</p><p>One of the characters, who goes by the alias &quot;Mouse&quot;, has programmed a woman in a red dress to be sent out into the Matrix. She serves as a distraction, literally a red herring (hence the color red). The way I interpreted it, it seemed like a message that humans who choose to lead a focused life have to cull a lot of distractions along the way to reach their goal(s). This is especially true in this digital age where such distractions abound.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-buddhism">About Buddhism<a class="hash-link" href="#about-buddhism" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>Central to religions like Buddhism is the practice of meditation. There are several kinds of meditation exercises, but one of the most basic ones involves focussing intently on your breath. That&#x27;s because it is a sure way of grounding you in the present moment. When Neo resists as he learns the truth about the Matrix and goes into a spiral, Morpheus asks him to breathe to stay calm. This is almost certainly a reference to the role of breath in staying grounded. It&#x27;s also not a coincidence that Morpheus seems to spout a lot of Buddhist koan-like statements such as this one:</p><blockquote><p>Neo: I thought it wasn&#x27;t real
Morpheus: Your mind makes it real
Neo: If you&#x27;re killed in the matrix, you die here?
Morpheus: The body cannot live without the mind </p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-discovery">About discovery<a class="hash-link" href="#about-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>When Trinity first meets Neo she says:</p><blockquote><p>It&#x27;s the question that drives us, Neo...The answer is out there looking for you and it will find you if you want it to</p></blockquote><p>This drives home the point about life being a process of search and discovery. Few of the truths we seek are objective, except perhaps those that we have stipulated and agreed upon as laws.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-belief">About belief<a class="hash-link" href="#about-belief" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>Neo spends a lot of the time believing that he is not the &quot;chosen One&quot;. However, when he&#x27;s forced to choose between his life and Morpheus&#x27;s life, he becomes much more decisive. He takes the reins of freeing Morpheus into his own hands. Even though he&#x27;s faced by agents who are much stronger and faster than he is, Neo is able to free his mind from fear and other delusions to unlock his true potential. In doing so, he sees the Matrix as it truly is: computer code processing data in a mainframe. He is, therefore, able to thwart the attempts made by the Matrix to control him.</p><p>The sparring session between Morpheus and neo underscores the importance of belief even further:</p><blockquote><p>Morpheus: How did I beat you?
Neo: You... you&#x27;re too fast.
Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that&#x27;s air you&#x27;re breathing now?</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-reality">About reality<a class="hash-link" href="#about-reality" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>As Morpheus is explaining the nature of the Matrix, he questions Neo:</p><blockquote><p>What is real? How do you define &#x27;real&#x27;? If you&#x27;re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then &#x27;real&#x27; is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p></blockquote><p>This alludes to that our mind is a VR simulator in itself: we form perceptions about the world in front of us, based on what are actually electrical sensory inputs.</p><p>Thinking about the &quot;real world&quot; in this light, it doesn&#x27;t seem absurd that Cerebro should wish to betray the other crew members and return to the Matrix. Is the outside world any less real than the world of the Matrix? It becomes a matter of perspective because you can hack your psychology to &quot;Blue Pill&quot; it away.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="about-love">About Love<a class="hash-link" href="#about-love" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>During Neo&#x27;s first meeting with the Oracle, she points to a banner and says:</p><blockquote><p>Do you know what means? It&#x27;s Latin. It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.</p></blockquote><p>True love, just like success and happiness, is an aspiration that is hard to achieve. The more you go out of the way to find &quot;true love&quot;, the more it seems to elude you. The best you can do is share your feelings with someone whom you truly find special. If you are lucky, you may find love on your first try. Often though, it takes trial and tribulations, rejections after rejections, before you find love. </p><p>In the end, you have to go with your gut because you can&#x27;t decode the inner workings of your mind.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/movies">movies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests">Encouraging kids to pursue their interests</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 5, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

That&#x27;s ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.</p><p>There are exceptions: the so called &quot;prodigies&quot;. <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson&#x27;s study</a> provides good grounds to study expert performance:</p><blockquote><p>The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.</p></blockquote><p>Hence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.</p><p>There are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:
1) &quot;Nurture&quot;: Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain</p><p>2) &quot;Nature&quot;: The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it&#x27;s a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast</p><p>That&#x27;s why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery.

It&#x27;s unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.</p><p>Most children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That&#x27;s because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent&#x27;s perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.</p><p>In the end, I believe it&#x27;s a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/career">career</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness">Creativity leads to happiness</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 30, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I&#x27;ll just share what I think.</p><p>My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. </p><p>One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. </p><p>Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. </p><p>Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. </p><p>As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other&#x27;s ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.</p><p>A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;A Man&#x27;s Search For Meaning&quot;</a> is in order here: &quot;In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.&quot; </p><p>Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it&#x27;s this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/happiness-is-success">Happiness is success</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 23, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Hard work, determination
and focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn
to become successful.</p><p>However, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions
our parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.
There is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing
goals and goals are largely individualistic.</p><p>It&#x27;s not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it&#x27;s important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make.
This reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even
having an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.</p><p>Just like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.</p><p>As you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. </p><p>Of course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.</p><p>They act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don&#x27;t get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. </p><p>With the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The only panacea to this information overload is to create</a>. Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.</p><p>When you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.</p><p>This is what I believe true success looks like.</p><blockquote><p>Inspired by reading a Kindle sample of &quot;Think Like A Monk&quot; by Jay Shetty</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity">Embrace the messiness of creativity</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 19, 2021</time> Â· <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann&#x27;s Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I&#x27;m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to &quot;unlock&quot; your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="learning">Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>As I&#x27;ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of &quot;connecting the dots&quot; in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conversing">Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can&#x27;t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that&#x27;s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="coding">Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn&#x27;t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn&#x27;t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn&#x27;t fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That&#x27;s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren&#x27;t going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="exercising">Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="writing">Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process of rewriting</a></p><p>Even that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That&#x27;s a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>All the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the &quot;focussed mode&quot; of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the &quot;diffused mode&quot; and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It&#x27;s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don&#x27;t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2022 Aadit Kamat.
