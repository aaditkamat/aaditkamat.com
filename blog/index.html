of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chanakya-Daily-Life-Radhakrishnan-Pillai/dp/8129144441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Chanakya in Daily Life&quot; by Radhakrishnan Pillai</a>.
This is one of the books that I instinctively know that I would keep coming back to over the years. It has distilled the 6,000 sutras from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra</a> that cover a wide range of topics (over 1, 000 by
the author&#x27;s estimation) into 3 components of life that are important
to everyone: personal, professional, and familial.</p><p>These are some of my takeaways from this book.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="writing-a-book"></a>Writing a book<a class="hash-link" href="#writing-a-book" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>A book is a major undertaking. It takes a minimum of 6 months to a year
of consistent writing once a rough outline is planned and a publisher
has accepted the proposal. Adding on top of that the other demands to ensure good book sales such as marketing it through various channels,
going through several rounds of editing and discussion with the publisher
and reaching out to beta readers for feedback, makes the journey seem even more daunting.</p><p>However, it&#x27;s a journey worth undertaking because you are leaving something for posterity.
The author cites the example of the Arthashastra. If Chanakya had not
written it, the future generations would have been left bereft of its wisdom.</p><p>If the idea of a book sounds impractical, it may help to maintain a diary
or a blog instead. The best time to write is at night as you can reflect
upon the happenings of the day. A month of journaling provides a lot of material
in itself. Over the span of a year, you may have enough writing to fit into a book.</p><p>An instance that springs to mind is the Diary of Anne Frank. The diary
was a coping mechanism for a young girl who was trying to survive the atrocities
that the Holocaust heaped upon her family and friend, as Jews in Nazi Germany.
It not only bore testament to her indomitable spirit in the face of adversity,
but also provided interesting insights into the psyche of a teenager.</p><p>Her struggles would be relatable to a lot of people today, who have had to bear the
the brunt of a surge of relentless lockdowns due to the current pandemic.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="listening-to-music"></a>Listening to music<a class="hash-link" href="#listening-to-music" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Music has the power to uplift your mood. In the past, kings would wake up to
the sound of royal music. Chanakya himself took great pains to
arrange the right kind of music, based on the king&#x27;s moods. To do so,
he sought counsel from some of the best music composers in the kingdom.</p><p>Nowadays, there are a plethora of playlists available thanks to streaming platforms
like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/browse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>, and
<a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Music</a>. The key here is to be
mindful in curating a playlist for the day, keeping in mind the fluctuations
of mood over the course of the day.</p><p>For example, if you need to focus most intently during the morning, you should select soft music. Increase the intensity of the music
as the pace of work picks up.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="developing-a-creative-hobby"></a>Developing a creative hobby<a class="hash-link" href="#developing-a-creative-hobby" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Apart from work, it is important to cultivate at least one or two hobbies
that keep you engaged. Without these, life can start to feel humdrum.</p><p>The best hobbies are the ones that involve some amount of creativity.
Writing, singing, dancing, cooking, and painting: all of these are creative
activities because they allow you to freely express yourself.</p><p>It may even be worthwhile to do <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/5-Minute-Creative-Workouts-Get-Your-Creativity-in-Shape/483111042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative workouts</a> once in a while to
shake things up. These allow you to put your &quot;creative muscles&quot; to work.
Nothing is sadder than the demise of a creative hobby.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="taking-a-power-nap"></a>Taking a power nap<a class="hash-link" href="#taking-a-power-nap" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>While this may sound counterintuitive, sometimes taking a nap can be
a major productivity boost. The best time of the day for such &quot;power naps&quot;
is the afternoon. It may be difficult to work those into your schedule, especially
if you are overloaded with work, but try to make time for such naps
on occasion.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="finding-a-mentor"></a>Finding a mentor<a class="hash-link" href="#finding-a-mentor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In this digital age, we have all the information from around the
globe at our fingertips as they say. One can also find tons of &quot;gurus&quot;
on social media platforms that seem to dispense good advice for free.</p><p>The main barrier though is what information you can trust. Another
concern is that even information from trusted sources can be harmful, if
it is misinterpreted.</p><p>Hence, it is important to find mentors or guides in the areas of life
that you wish to succeed. Before you seek them out though, you need
to ascertain first whether these areas are indeed truly important to you.</p><p>The author mentions his example to illustrate this point. Due to the lack of formal training material on Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra, he had to reach out to a Sanskrit scholar from the <a href="https://www.chinmayamission.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinmaya mission</a> who could educate him on the meaning of the different sutras.
This has allowed the author to craft this book, as well as several others, based on the
teachings from the Arthashastra.</p><p>--</p><p>The book covers over 70 topics, so there&#x27;s a wealth of information
for anyone and everyone. There are simple yet powerful principles
to design a fulfilling life. I hope that my takeaways inspire more people
to pick up this book right away.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-matrix">My thoughts on the Matrix</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-10-10T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">October 10, 2021 · 6 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I had watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; a couple of years ago. I enjoyed watching it, but I could not appreciate the inherently philosophical nature of the movie. A close friend of mine who had watched it recently suggested that I rewatch it as he believed that I would be able to glean new insights from the film. And indeed, I could not help but marvel at its beauty. It feels as though each line from the film has some nugget of wisdom hidden in it. That&#x27;s why I thought that I would write up a blog post sharing some of my takeaways from the film.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-choice"></a>About choice<a class="hash-link" href="#about-choice" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>At a surface level, it&#x27;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeovers_in_popular_culture#1950s_and_earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dystopian science fiction film that discusses the existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence</a>. However, at a deeper level, the movie talks about choice: the role humans can play in shaping their destinies.</p><p>One of the scenes that immediately pops up to the mind is the choice between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill that Neo has to make if he wants to truly understand the nature of the Matrix. However, there are several other small or big choices that Neo has to make: choosing to follow Trinity&#x27;s instructions or searching for Morpheus on his own, choosing to believe that he is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; or not, choosing to risk his life to save Morpheus&#x27;s life. </p><p>The freedom of choice is juxtaposed with the role of destiny. As Neo says to Morpheus, he does not believe in fate because that means that he does not have control over his life. This seems to apply pretty well to the world of the Matrix because it is meant to be deterministic but may not apply to the &quot;real world&quot;. However, it highlights the human tendency to be proactive, as opposed to reactive, and try to expand their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/980363-proactive-people-focus-their-efforts-in-the-circle-of-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circle of influence</a>.</p><p>One of the characters, who goes by the alias &quot;Mouse&quot;, has programmed a woman in a red dress to be sent out into the Matrix. She serves as a distraction, literally a red herring (hence the color red). The way I interpreted it, it seemed like a message that humans who choose to lead a focused life have to cull a lot of distractions along the way to reach their goal(s). This is especially true in this digital age where such distractions abound.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-buddhism"></a>About Buddhism<a class="hash-link" href="#about-buddhism" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Central to religions like Buddhism is the practice of meditation. There are several kinds of meditation exercises, but one of the most basic ones involves focussing intently on your breath. That&#x27;s because it is a sure way of grounding you in the present moment. When Neo resists as he learns the truth about the Matrix and goes into a spiral, Morpheus asks him to breathe to stay calm. This is almost certainly a reference to the role of breath in staying grounded. It&#x27;s also not a coincidence that Morpheus seems to spout a lot of Buddhist koan-like statements such as this one:</p><blockquote><p>Neo: I thought it wasn&#x27;t real
Morpheus: Your mind makes it real
Neo: If you&#x27;re killed in the matrix, you die here?
Morpheus: The body cannot live without the mind </p></blockquote><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-discovery"></a>About discovery<a class="hash-link" href="#about-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When Trinity first meets Neo she says:</p><blockquote><p>It&#x27;s the question that drives us, Neo...The answer is out there looking for you and it will find you if you want it to</p></blockquote><p>This drives home the point about life being a process of search and discovery. Few of the truths we seek are objective, except perhaps those that we have stipulated and agreed upon as laws.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-belief"></a>About belief<a class="hash-link" href="#about-belief" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Neo spends a lot of the time believing that he is not the &quot;chosen One&quot;. However, when he&#x27;s forced to choose between his life and Morpheus&#x27;s life, he becomes much more decisive. He takes the reins of freeing Morpheus into his own hands. Even though he&#x27;s faced by agents who are much stronger and faster than he is, Neo is able to free his mind from fear and other delusions to unlock his true potential. In doing so, he sees the Matrix as it truly is: computer code processing data in a mainframe. He is, therefore, able to thwart the attempts made by the Matrix to control him.</p><p>The sparring session between Morpheus and neo underscores the importance of belief even further:</p><blockquote><p>Morpheus: How did I beat you?
Neo: You... you&#x27;re too fast.
Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that&#x27;s air you&#x27;re breathing now?</p></blockquote><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-reality"></a>About reality<a class="hash-link" href="#about-reality" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As Morpheus is explaining the nature of the Matrix, he questions Neo:</p><blockquote><p>What is real? How do you define &#x27;real&#x27;? If you&#x27;re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then &#x27;real&#x27; is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p></blockquote><p>This alludes to that our mind is a VR simulator in itself: we form perceptions about the world in front of us, based on what are actually electrical sensory inputs.</p><p>Thinking about the &quot;real world&quot; in this light, it doesn&#x27;t seem absurd that Cerebro should wish to betray the other crew members and return to the Matrix. Is the outside world any less real than the world of the Matrix? It becomes a matter of perspective because you can hack your psychology to &quot;Blue Pill&quot; it away.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-love"></a>About Love<a class="hash-link" href="#about-love" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>During Neo&#x27;s first meeting with the Oracle, she points to a banner and says:</p><blockquote><p>Do you know what means? It&#x27;s Latin. It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.</p></blockquote><p>True love, just like success and happiness, is an aspiration that is hard to achieve. The more you go out of the way to find &quot;true love&quot;, the more it seems to elude you. The best you can do is share your feelings with someone whom you truly find special. If you are lucky, you may find love on your first try. Often though, it takes trial and tribulations, rejections after rejections, before you find love. </p><p>In the end, you have to go with your gut because you can&#x27;t decode the inner workings of your mind.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/movies">movies</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests">Encouraging kids to pursue their interests</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">October 5, 2021 · 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Kids usually have no idea about what they wish to pursue as a career growing up. That&#x27;s ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.</p><p>There are exceptions: the so called &quot;prodigies&quot;. <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson&#x27;s study</a> provides good grounds to study expert performance:</p><blockquote><p>The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.</p></blockquote><p>Hence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.</p><p>There are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:
1) &quot;Nurture&quot;: Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain</p><p>2) &quot;Nature&quot;: The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it&#x27;s a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast</p><p>That&#x27;s why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery. If you force them to pick something else to specialize in, they are likely to have some regret: &quot;what if, instead, I had pursued something I was truly interested in&quot;? </p><p>Trevor Noah has expressed this sentiment beautifully in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1633442048&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Born A Crime&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days</p></blockquote><p>When kids don&#x27;t have any idea, any domain they choose to specialize is good because the only things stopping the kid are hard work and determination. It&#x27;s unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.</p><p>Most children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That&#x27;s because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent&#x27;s perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.</p><p>In the end, I believe it&#x27;s a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/career">career</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness">Creativity leads to happiness</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 30, 2021 · 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In my <a href="/blog/happiness-is-success">previous blog post</a>, I had discussed about how happiness is a measure of success. </p><p>But one might ask, how do you attain happiness? </p><p>This is one of the questions that humans have posed for ages. It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I&#x27;ll just share what I think.</p><p>My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. </p><p>One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. </p><p>Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. </p><p>Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. </p><p>As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other&#x27;s ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.</p><p>A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;A Man&#x27;s Search For Meaning&quot;</a> is in order here: &quot;In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.&quot; </p><p>Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it&#x27;s this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/happiness-is-success">Happiness is success</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 23, 2021 · 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>What our parents have taught us from a young is mostly true. Hard work, determination
and focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn
to become successful.</p><p>However, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions
our parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.
There is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing
goals and goals are largely individualistic.</p><p>It&#x27;s not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it&#x27;s important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make.
This reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even
having an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.</p><p>Just like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.</p><p>As you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. </p><p>Of course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.</p><p>They act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don&#x27;t get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. </p><p>With the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The only panacea to this information overload is to create</a>. Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.</p><p>When you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.</p><p>This is what I believe true success looks like.</p><blockquote><p>Inspired by reading a Kindle sample of &quot;Think Like A Monk&quot; by Jay Shetty</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity">Embrace the messiness of creativity</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 19, 2021 · 6 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>We often like to look at the end result and awe at the mastery involved in creating that result. However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann&#x27;s Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I&#x27;m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to &quot;unlock&quot; your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learning"></a>Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As I&#x27;ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of &quot;connecting the dots&quot; in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="conversing"></a>Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can&#x27;t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that&#x27;s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="coding"></a>Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn&#x27;t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn&#x27;t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn&#x27;t fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That&#x27;s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren&#x27;t going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercising"></a>Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="writing"></a>Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process of rewriting</a></p><p>Even that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That&#x27;s a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="summary"></a>Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the &quot;focussed mode&quot; of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the &quot;diffused mode&quot; and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It&#x27;s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don&#x27;t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/it&#x27;s-ok-to-forget">It&#x27;s Ok To Forget</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 11, 2021 · 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Podcast link: <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/</a></p><p>I just tuned into an episode of one of my favourite podcasts &quot;No Stupid Questions&quot; by Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner. I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.</p><p>My own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="forgetting-curve"></a>Forgetting curve<a class="hash-link" href="#forgetting-curve" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>That is because our brain has a &quot;forgetting curve&quot; just as it has a &quot;learning curve&quot;: you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.
The dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-role-of-intention"></a>The role of intention<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-of-intention" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Your brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. </p><p>However, it&#x27;s unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-importance-of-context"></a>The importance of context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-context" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Angela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="much-room-for-misinterpretation"></a>Much room for misinterpretation<a class="hash-link" href="#much-room-for-misinterpretation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>It is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. </p><p>As Stephen says towards the end, &quot;My job is to write and the reader&#x27;s job is to read and forget&quot;. In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/podcasts">podcasts</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/deep-human-a-review">Deep Human - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-05T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 5, 2021 · 7 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52455951-deep-human" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52455951-deep-human</a></p><p>In this book, Crystal Lim-Lange, the former Director for the Centre of Future-Ready Graduates (CFG) at the National University of Singapore and Dr. Greg Lim-Lange, the former Head for the Learning &amp; Development at CFG share the 5 skills, which they call &quot;Deep Human Superskills&quot;, that they believe are important for professionals to thrive in the age of automation where existing industries are being disrupted by technological interventions.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="skill-1-focus--mindfulness"></a>Skill 1: Focus &amp; Mindfulness<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-1-focus--mindfulness" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As Crystal and Greg put it, we have become the &quot;champions of distractedness&quot;. This becomes self-evident as we observe the people around us during the commute, glued to their mobile devices and unaware of their surroundings. </p><p>Secular mindfulness, the mindfulness techniques that are not specific to any particular religion, allow you to focus on the internal sensations of the body by observing them in a non-judgemental way.</p><p>To highlight the benefits of integrating mindfulness into your daily life, Crystal has shared the experiences of students that have taken CFG1010 who are aware of the overpowering influence of technology in their lives and how they became more attentive during the class after practising mindfulness techniques. A similar effect has been observed amongst employees who have attended group mindfulness sessions.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="skill-2-self-awareness"></a>Skill 2: Self-Awareness<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-2-self-awareness" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Without self-awareness, we will not be able to regulate our emotions and understand why we behave the way we do. This can lead us to subconsciously get into negative patterns of thinking and live life on autopilot. Having great internal self-awareness allows us to have better control over the four main constituents of self: the mind, our body, our soul and spirituality. Internal self-awareness can be cultivated by practising mindfulness during different activities.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="skill-3-empathy"></a>Skill 3: Empathy<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-3-empathy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Empathy is what makes us human. It allows us to see the world from another&#x27;s perspective. When we can apply this skill successfully in our careers and our life in general, the results are magical.</p><p>There are 3 modes of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cognitive empathy</strong>: Cognitive empathy means that we can understand what the other is going through but does not necessarily mean that we share this empathy. This can be employed successfully by manipulators to read you like a book and trick you into doing what they want. This need not always be used negatively though, as doctors for example can distance themselves from the pain that the patient is going through even as they understand it very precisely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional empathy</strong>: Emotional empathy, on the other hand, means that we experience the same emotions that the other person is going through due to the &quot;mirror neurons&quot; in our brain. This is what causes us to wince in pain when we see someone hurting badly on the television, even as we are not going through the same pain ourselves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compassionate empathy</strong>: Compassionate empathy takes this a step further, where we strongly feel that we should do all we can in our power to reduce the suffering of the other person.</p></li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="skill-4-complex-communication"></a>Skill 4: Complex Communication<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-4-complex-communication" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Complex Communication is required to give the right feedback to the people we work with. This involved conveying our emotional state as accurately as we can. It is complex because we are not always aware of the inner workings of the black box that is our mind, which is influenced by different moods due to different factors such as the time of the day, the weather and the events that have taken place up to the point. When it comes to others, this gets even worse because they are even harder to read. To master this skill, we need to tap on the other skills such as self-awareness and empathy.</p><p>In place of the &quot;shit sandwich&quot; model of giving feedback: negative feedback hidden within the layers of positive feedback, which may either downplay the negative feedback or seem facetious, the authors propose the SBIFI model: Situation, Behaviour, Impact, Future, In-Group.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Situation</strong>: Focus on one specific situation to give feedback on rather than resort to generalities such as &quot;you always&quot; or &quot;you never&quot;. In general, humans are not very good at multitasking and this applies to digesting critical feedback as well. That is why focusing on one specific situation is essential for communicating what went wrong or what could be improved in a way that the person receiving feedback can take concrete action on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behaviour</strong>: Describe the person&#x27;s behaviour as precisely as you can and mention that you felt that it was inappropriate for the situation. Do not include other people in this assessment by saying &quot;All of us think that you should...&quot; because what you feel may not apply universally. </p></li><li><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Let the person know the consequences of his actions on the behaviour of others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Future</strong>: Provide feedback in a way that helps the person reflect on ways he could improve.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-Group</strong>: Share the vision and mission of the organisation and how the work done by the person fits into it.</p></li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="skill-5-adaptive-resilience"></a>Skill 5: Adaptive Resilience<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-5-adaptive-resilience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Adaptive Resilience is perhaps one of the most important. In life, you are likely to face a lot of challenges and your success in part depends on the ability to adapt to them as well as persist through them. </p><p>To explain this concept, Crystal invokes the idea of the &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; mindset proposed by Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford. </p><p>A fixed mindset leads you to believe that you cannot change and things will mostly remain as they are. This mindset can be developed due to a person&#x27;s upbringing and personal circumstances.
A growth mindset, on the other hand, allows you to see the temporary nature of setbacks and work to learn and grow from them instead of resorting to learned helplessness. </p><p>This very much relates to the idea of growing your sphere of influence/control proposed by Stephen Covey in 7 Habits of Highly Successful People. A growth mindset may not help you succeed, as luck plays a huge role as well, but a fixed mindset is almost certain to lead to failure.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="my-takeaways"></a>My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I had first come to know Crystal and Greg Lim Lange, when I had taken the CFG1010: Roots and Wings module during the first semester of my studies at NUS. I found it a nice detour from the regular course workload that I was taking as it was non-technical and introduced concepts that were quite novel. </p><p>However, at the back of my mind, I harboured a notion that was prevalent amongst most other students in technical fields: what was needed to succeed and ultimately land the interviews that would get me my internships and my first job after college would be my technical skills and not the &quot;soft skills&quot;. Hence, I could not appreciate the wisdom behind the ideas covered in the book (a compilation of the ideas also covered in the course).</p><p>I have acquired a renewed taste in this book with each subsequent reading and this will most likely be the book that I will keep referring to at different stages of my career, to do a sort of rain check that will help me see where I am at and where I want to be. Through my own experiences, I have come to realise just how important the skills mentioned in the book truly are. </p><p>As famously said by Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who has been cited a couple of times in the book, &quot;IQ Gets You Hired, EQ Gets You Promoted&quot;. These are, I believe, so important that you should seek a role where you can hone these skills if you can, even as a job applicant.</p><p>It&#x27;s quite hard to appreciate the significance of these skills especially as an undergraduate student specializing in an academically rigorous technical field where much emphasis is still placed on the &quot;hard skills&quot;. However, you can&#x27;t just sustain with the &quot;hard skills&quot; because you need to work with others, manage your own emotions and also craft a productive lifestyle around your work in the long run.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/so-good-they-can&#x27;t-ignore-you-a-review">So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 2, 2021 · 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you</a></p><p>In this book written in 2012, Cal Newport, a professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University, distils his career advice into a set of four rules that centre around the concept of being &quot;so good they can&#x27;t ignore you&quot;.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion"></a>Rule #1: Don&#x27;t follow your passion<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The main aim of this book is to take on the &quot;passion hypothesis&quot;: follow your passion and the money will come. This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-2-build-skills"></a>Rule #2: Build Skills<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-2-build-skills" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. </p><p>To build career capital, Cal describes the necessary &quot;craftsman mindset&quot;. Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.</p><p>To build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. </p><p>Of course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-3-the-importance-of-control"></a>Rule #3: The Importance of Control<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-3-the-importance-of-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Through this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. </p><p>The former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don&#x27;t have a backup plan. </p><p>The second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don&#x27;t know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it&#x27;s likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission"></a>Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>According to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="other-important-concepts"></a>Other important concepts<a class="hash-link" href="#other-important-concepts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets.
According to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. </p><p>When you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don&#x27;t have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="my-takeaways"></a>My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it&#x27;s hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. </p><p>I do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review">Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 28, 2021 · 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro</a></p><p>Even though I have graduated from college, I felt that it was necessary for me to read this book to become an effective lifelong learner. I had taken the popular MOOC &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot; taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn&#x27;t fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. </p><p>Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way"></a>Increase focus the Pomodoro Way<a class="hash-link" href="#increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="get-enough-sleep"></a>Get enough sleep<a class="hash-link" href="#get-enough-sleep" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="seperate-editing-from-writing"></a>Seperate editing from writing<a class="hash-link" href="#seperate-editing-from-writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="make-your-learning-active"></a>Make your learning active<a class="hash-link" href="#make-your-learning-active" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="simulate-the-exam-conditions"></a>Simulate the exam conditions<a class="hash-link" href="#simulate-the-exam-conditions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy"></a>Exercise regularly and eat healthy<a class="hash-link" href="#exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="follow-the-instructions"></a>Follow the instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#follow-the-instructions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="interleave-your-studies"></a>Interleave your studies<a class="hash-link" href="#interleave-your-studies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test</p><p>Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries »</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 Aadit Kamat.
