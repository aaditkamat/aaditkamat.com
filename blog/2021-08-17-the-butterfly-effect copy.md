Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms. 

That's why most tech companies have teams managing load balancing on their servers and perform stress testing to ensure the reliability of the systems. The engineers working in these departments inevitably have to work for longer hours or even odd hours to support systems when they eventually crash. 

This is an example of how an innocuous action like posting can have a larger scale impact on the lives of others. It is perhaps captured best through the metaphor of the "Butterfly Effect". Such effects have probably panned out on a bigger scale to phenomena such as climate change that can be described as hyperobjects, events spanning across a large amount of space and time that are a complex intermingling of many different interactions. 

We have to be kind to ourselves as a species because we are not good at predicting the future. That's just not the way we are engineered. With time, we have evolved to set long term goals and work towards them, but we've to spend most of the time looking out for what lies ahead of us in the immediate future.Â
