Money can be viewed primarily as a medium of exchange for goods and services. As history goes, different forms of money have evolved from the barter system where one person, the buyer, offers goods or services to the other person, the seller in return for goods or services of equivalent value. 

For such a system to succeed, there are two key requirements that must be met. First, both parties involved must be fairly acquainted with each other for the exchange to take place. Second, the exchange must mutually benefit them in a way that they perceive as being of equivalent value. 

As one can see, such a system quickly becomes cumbersome and unsustainable over time. Hence, it was necessary for humans to come up with a replacement that would allow people to transact without having these two key requirements in place.

Today, money plays that role since the buyer does not need to provide anything of material value to the seller apart from monetary payment. In return the buyer is expected to participate in the economy through some way, typically through the employment, where he ends up providing a valuable good or service to others in the company in which he is employed or to consumers directly if he is self-employed. 

There are exceptions to this rule, but the engine of modern economy treads forward when the balance is maintained, as the supply meets the demand.
