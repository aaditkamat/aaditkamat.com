I was listening to a conversation between Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens, the creator of the popular YouTube channel VSauce, over the Lex Fridman podcast. They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.


One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.


This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, "Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty". A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.
