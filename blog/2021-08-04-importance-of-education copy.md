Education equips individuals with basic literacy skills like reading and writing. While the primary aim of modern education is to help students develop a set of core competencies or "hard skills", it also helps them furnish soft skills like communication and teamwork that are becoming more and more critical in the workplace.


The value of education is intrinsic: you simply cannot judge the value of education by looking at the return of investment. This is because, you cannot pre-emptively determine how your learning in prior years will become relevant later on in life.


Education enhances the quality of your mind. Having a well-developed mind is essential for developing the cognitive abilities needed to make sense of the vast array of information we are exposed to in the current times.


Many of the problems in the current education systems around the world arise due to an over emphasis on testing and grades. Teachers are obligated to complete the topics within the curriculum on time. To ensure that students are learning at the right pace, they have to assign homework. Sometimes, the amount of homework assigned becomes too much and this leaves the student less time to engage with other activities that are important for their development. It is important to re-evaluate current education models so that we can achieve a right balance and make education more holistic.
