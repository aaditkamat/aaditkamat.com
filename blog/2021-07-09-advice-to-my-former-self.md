There comes a time after a student graduates where he reflects back upon his journey through the undergraduate days, usually right after his graduation. These are the four things that I wish I had known as an undergraduate student back in college.


First, I wish I hadn't gotten into the rat race to achieve stellar grades or bag prestigious internships at the top companies, just out of peer pressure. As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I'd instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they'd likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.


Second, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.


Third, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.


Last, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual's perspective. People will always have some regrets when they reflect back upon their college days. So take this advice with a pinch of salt and enjoy the college journey while you can!
