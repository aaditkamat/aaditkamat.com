In my [previous blog post](./2021-09-23-happiness-is-success.md), I had discussed about how happiness is a measure of success. 

But one might ask, how do you attain happiness? 

This is one of the questions that humans have posed for ages. It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I'll just share what I think.

My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. 

One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. 

Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. 

Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. 

As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other's ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.

A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book ["A Man's Search For Meaning"](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI) is in order here: "In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice." 

Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it's this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.
