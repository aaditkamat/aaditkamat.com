Even though I have graduated from college, I felt that it was necessary for me to read this book to become an effective lifelong learner. I had taken the popular MOOC "Learning How To Learn" taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn't fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. 

Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:

## Increase focus the Pomodoro Way
When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.

## Get enough sleep
Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.

## Seperate editing from writing
As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.

## Make your learning active
Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.

## Simulate the exam conditions
Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.

## Exercise regularly and eat healthy
It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.

## Follow the instructions
Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.

## Interleave your studies
Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test

Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.
