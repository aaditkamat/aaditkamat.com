Just as industrialization had created physical consumer markets through surplus production of goods, digitalization has created digital consumer markets through surplus production of content. 

It's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of consumption once you get exposed to different kinds of information on the different media platforms. The main difference is that digital media platforms have access to more data and sophisticated algorithms to better analyze insights from the data so that they can essentially "hack into your psychology". 

This has become an even bigger problem [thanks to the pandemic](https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-digital-addiction-made-worse-covid-19) where people are cut off from each other due to social distancing and forced to spend more time at home, left to their digital devices. 

I have experienced this personally. I used to be wary of using social media longer than intended before I enrolled in college. However, in a bid to form connections as a college student, I ended up mindlessly following a lot of people on different social media platforms. In particular, as I started spending more time at home after the pandemic, I found myself becoming addicted to Twitter. 

Twitter seemed great as I had access to thoughts from different great minds on the planets via their Tweets. I also did not have to read news articles or watch the news channels - I could read the summaries on my Twitter feed instead. 

I only began to grasp the gravity of the problem after I lashed out at my parents in anger, for no fault of theirs. As I reflected upon the cause of my anger, I realized it was due to pent-up frustration - the frustration triggered by all the social justice-related Tweets I had read. 

I hadn't been doing great in school up till that point, but I ended up sinking more time into social media than I should have and this most certainly contributed to my grades tanking.  

I can be impulsive, so once I read [a blog post written by Cal Newport that resonated with me](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/), I decided to deactivate most of my social media handles. This did help curb the addiction, but I soon realized that it wasn't a good long-term solution. I found a [better way to use social media](https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-make-social-media-work-for-you-part-i/): to share the essays I was writing through the #Ship30for30 challenge or on my blog. 

Going on "social media lite" made me understand an important principle that seems to apply in other areas as well: limit consumption and increase production. You have to consume as you need to learn from others. However, when you switch to the productivity mode, you switch to a mindset of what value do you provide - giving more than you take. 

That's why there is so much emphasis on productivity in the modern world. No matter what kind of work you do, you are providing some kind of value. You get paid precisely because you provide value. Your value increases when you focus on what you can give rather than what you receive in the form of benefits. 

Even if we leave aside the career aspect of productivity aside, I believe that channeling productivity, such as through [creativity, increases happiness](https://aaditkamat.github.io/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness) in the long run as it gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This comes in handy especially when you need to soldier through the challenges in life.

That is why the minimalist philosophy is so appealing. As you adopt this philosophy, you start to realize that you don't need too much to be happy. This allows you to step down from the hedonistic treadmill, which leaves you craving for more and more. 

Whilst the pandemic has been a major upheaval that left much destruction in its wake, it has also been a stark reminder of what truly matters: human connection and mental/physical wellbeing over materialistic wealth. Producing good work and sharing it with other people in the community who may benefit from it sparks true joy. Even when things don't turn out the way you expected, which happens more often than not, you feel contented as you have given your best, which is all you could have done under the circumstances.

We cannot unplug ourselves from the internet, but the best way we can make sense of all the information we are exposed to without becoming overwhelmed is to use it to create something of our own and share it with others.
