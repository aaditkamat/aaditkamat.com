Patience is a personality trait enshrined within the morals of stories that most of us have grown up with. On a personal level, it's something that I hope to build up with time.

It's often said that millennials and Gen-Z ers have become impatient as they have grown up in the lap of luxury afforded to them by the technological advances made in the 21st century. Like most statements of this nature, this is also a tantalizing generalization. It's not that surprising though, to see people of the older generation bemoan this apparent truth. Technological progress has indeed widened the gulf between the generations. The whole new world of opportunities afforded to us has made us impatient for results. 

Why then is patience so important, especially in these times? This is because the goals we strive to attain for are mostly long term. Whether its' a good home, a loving family or stable financial wealth we are talking about, success don't come about in a jiffy. Being cliched here, but it takes blood, sweat and tears to build all of these.

This is the ethic that our parents have been trying inculcate since young, and it's often when you truly mature that you realize why they have been doing so. When you invest in key areas of growth in your life, you cannot always expect quick returns. You have to wait, often for a long period of time, before you see your investments bearing fruit. Patience is a virtue that will help you take on the challenges in your life and eventually tide over them because it helps you see the bigger picture.
