It was announced on 11th June in Singapore that [those in the age group of 
12 to 39](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-aged-12-to-39-can-book-vaccination-appointments-from-friday) 
could register interest to sign up for vaccine appointments by filling in 
their particulars in a [simple registration form.](https://preregister.vaccine.gov.sg)


As my parents had already gotten vaccinated, I filled up this form as soon 
as I could. After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to 
provide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at 
one of the [clinics or vaccination centers](https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs) for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have 
been given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to 
receive this SMS.

Another thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for 
booking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I 
believe that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered 
to the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer 
vaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly 
[higher efficacy](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/) and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown [milder side-effects](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna).

However, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the 
Moderna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as 
compared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting 
my shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore 
Government is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to 
get their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the 
population vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up, 
as evidenced by examples of [other developed nations reopening, 
particularly in the West](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious).

I'm glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination. 
Thankfully, I did not experience any of the [symptoms mentioned in the 
information sheet](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf), so I left immediately after the observation period was over. 

Upon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also 
received two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my 
family has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they 
were being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise 
caution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from 
the Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.

I would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug 
allergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about 
whether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug 
allergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with 
the ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice: 
[Moderna](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf) or [Pfizer](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf). Rest assured, you will be asked the required 
questions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well 
as before you take the vaccine.

Before you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it's easier to roll them up as you get your shot.

With this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the [COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs).

At the time of this writing, I'm feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab.
