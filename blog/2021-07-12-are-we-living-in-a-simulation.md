I first started to contemplate the idea of whether reality is a simulation as I reflected upon the complexity of human life and the history of mankind. 

Two key events sparked this line of thought: reading Sapiens, a magnum opus written by the celebrated historian Yuval Noah Harari, as well as discussing about meditating on the nature of reality with a dear friend. It's how we as a human society have reached where we are right now, achieving technological progress at an ever-accelerating pace, that has perplexed me.


I'm a theist but I've not really subscribed to one religious view completely, even as a practicing Hindu. I used to conceptualise God as a supernatural force that permeates the very fabric of the cosmos. 

Now though, the idea that we may be living in a simulation opens up entertaining possibilities. Are we characters being controlled by players of an arcade game? Are we a hive mind that is being controlled by a computer? Or perhaps all of this has originated in a single mind that has been coerced to live in a dream?


Of course, none of the questions I have posed here are novel. In fact, they have been inspired from popular fiction such as the Matrix, Bladerunner, the Truman Show and Dark City that has delved into this topic. However, my personal beliefs have been reinforced as I view the world around me, whose many aspects I used to take for granted earlier. 

For those interested to learn more about this topic, I'd recommend reading the seminal paper on the Simulation Hypothesis authored by Nick Bostrom and a book with a similar title written by Rizwan Virk, a former MIT graduate student and professional game developer.
