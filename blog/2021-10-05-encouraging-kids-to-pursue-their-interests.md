Kids usually have no idea about what they wish to pursue as a career growing up. That's ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.

There are exceptions: the so called "prodigies". [Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson's study](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273) provides good grounds to study expert performance:

> The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.
 
Hence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.

There are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:
1) "Nurture": Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain
    
2) "Nature": The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it's a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast

That's why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery. If you force them to pick something else to specialize in, they are likely to have some regret: "what if, instead, I had pursued something I was truly interested in"? 

Trevor Noah has expressed this sentiment beautifully in his book ["Born A Crime"](https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1633442048&sr=8-1):

> We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days

When kids don't have any idea, any domain they choose to specialize is good because the only things stopping the kid are hard work and determination. It's unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.

Most children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That's because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent's perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.

In the end, I believe it's a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take.
