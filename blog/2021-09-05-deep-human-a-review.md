In this book, Crystal Lim-Lange, the former Director for the Centre of Future-Ready Graduates (CFG) at the National University of Singapore and Dr. Greg Lim-Lange, the former Head for the Learning & Development at CFG share the 5 skills, which they call "Deep Human Superskills", that they believe are important for professionals to thrive in the age of automation where existing industries are being disrupted by technological interventions.

## Skill 1: Focus & Mindfulness
As Crystal and Greg put it, we have become the "champions of distractedness". This becomes self-evident as we observe the people around us during the commute, glued to their mobile devices and unaware of their surroundings. 

Secular mindfulness, the mindfulness techniques that are not specific to any particular religion, allow you to focus on the internal sensations of the body by observing them in a non-judgemental way.

To highlight the benefits of integrating mindfulness into your daily life, Crystal has shared the experiences of students that have taken CFG1010 who are aware of the overpowering influence of technology in their lives and how they became more attentive during the class after practising mindfulness techniques. A similar effect has been observed amongst employees who have attended group mindfulness sessions.

## Skill 2: Self-Awareness
Without self-awareness, we will not be able to regulate our emotions and understand why we behave the way we do. This can lead us to subconsciously get into negative patterns of thinking and live life on autopilot. Having great internal self-awareness allows us to have better control over the four main constituents of self: the mind, our body, our soul and spirituality. Internal self-awareness can be cultivated by practising mindfulness during different activities.

## Skill 3: Empathy
Empathy is what makes us human. It allows us to see the world from another's perspective. When we can apply this skill successfully in our careers and our life in general, the results are magical.

There are 3 modes of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.

1. **Cognitive empathy**: Cognitive empathy means that we can understand what the other is going through but does not necessarily mean that we share this empathy. This can be employed successfully by manipulators to read you like a book and trick you into doing what they want. This need not always be used negatively though, as doctors for example can distance themselves from the pain that the patient is going through even as they understand it very precisely.

2. **Emotional empathy**: Emotional empathy, on the other hand, means that we experience the same emotions that the other person is going through due to the "mirror neurons" in our brain. This is what causes us to wince in pain when we see someone hurting badly on the television, even as we are not going through the same pain ourselves.

3. **Compassionate empathy**: Compassionate empathy takes this a step further, where we strongly feel that we should do all we can in our power to reduce the suffering of the other person.

## Skill 4: Complex Communication
Complex Communication is required to give the right feedback to the people we work with. This involved conveying our emotional state as accurately as we can. It is complex because we are not always aware of the inner workings of the black box that is our mind, which is influenced by different moods due to different factors such as the time of the day, the weather and the events that have taken place up to the point. When it comes to others, this gets even worse because they are even harder to read. To master this skill, we need to tap on the other skills such as self-awareness and empathy.

In place of the "shit sandwich" model of giving feedback: negative feedback hidden within the layers of positive feedback, which may either downplay the negative feedback or seem facetious, the authors propose the SBIFI model: Situation, Behaviour, Impact, Future, In-Group.

1. **Situation**: Focus on one specific situation to give feedback on rather than resort to generalities such as "you always" or "you never". In general, humans are not very good at multitasking and this applies to digesting critical feedback as well. That is why focusing on one specific situation is essential for communicating what went wrong or what could be improved in a way that the person receiving feedback can take concrete action on.

2. **Behaviour**: Describe the person's behaviour as precisely as you can and mention that you felt that it was inappropriate for the situation. Do not include other people in this assessment by saying "All of us think that you should..." because what you feel may not apply universally. 

3. **Impact**: Let the person know the consequences of his actions on the behaviour of others.

4. **Future**: Provide feedback in a way that helps the person reflect on ways he could improve.

5. **In-Group**: Share the vision and mission of the organisation and how the work done by the person fits into it.

## Skill 5: Adaptive Resilience
Adaptive Resilience is perhaps one of the most important. In life, you are likely to face a lot of challenges and your success in part depends on the ability to adapt to them as well as persist through them. 

To explain this concept, Crystal invokes the idea of the "fixed" and "growth" mindset proposed by Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford. 

A fixed mindset leads you to believe that you cannot change and things will mostly remain as they are. This mindset can be developed due to a person's upbringing and personal circumstances.
A growth mindset, on the other hand, allows you to see the temporary nature of setbacks and work to learn and grow from them instead of resorting to learned helplessness. 

This very much relates to the idea of growing your sphere of influence/control proposed by Stephen Covey in 7 Habits of Highly Successful People. A growth mindset may not help you succeed, as luck plays a huge role as well, but a fixed mindset is almost certain to lead to failure.

## My takeaways
I had first come to know Crystal and Greg Lim Lange, when I had taken the CFG1010: Roots and Wings module during the first semester of my studies at NUS. I found it a nice detour from the regular course workload that I was taking as it was non-technical and introduced concepts that were quite novel. 

However, at the back of my mind, I harboured a notion that was prevalent amongst most other students in technical fields: what was needed to succeed and ultimately land the interviews that would get me my internships and my first job after college would be my technical skills and not the "soft skills". Hence, I could not appreciate the wisdom behind the ideas covered in the book (a compilation of the ideas also covered in the course).

I have acquired a renewed taste in this book with each subsequent reading and this will most likely be the book that I will keep referring to at different stages of my career, to do a sort of rain check that will help me see where I am at and where I want to be. Through my own experiences, I have come to realise just how important the skills mentioned in the book truly are. 

As famously said by Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who has been cited a couple of times in the book, "IQ Gets You Hired, EQ Gets You Promoted". These are, I believe, so important that you should seek a role where you can hone these skills if you can, even as a job applicant.

It's quite hard to appreciate the significance of these skills especially as an undergraduate student specializing in an academically rigorous technical field where much emphasis is still placed on the "hard skills". However, you can't just sustain with the "hard skills" because you need to work with others, manage your own emotions and also craft a productive lifestyle around your work in the long run.
