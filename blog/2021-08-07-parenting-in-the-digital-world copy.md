In this digital age, children are exposed to a vast amount of information through the internet. On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.


Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent's advice instead of taking it as the gospel.


Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.


Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.
