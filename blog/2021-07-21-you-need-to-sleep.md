I love to sleep. I mean, who doesn't honestly? At the same time, I'm also quite fussy about my sleep. If I get more sleep than I need, I feel like I'm being lazy. On the other hand, if I sleep too less, I end up feeling more tired. I've been trying for that sweet spot of 7 hours.

Of course, different people have different requirements. If you can subsist on less sleep, then go ahead by all means. At the end of the day, you know what's best for your own body.

What's important is that you don't skimp on the hours that your body actually needs. If this starts to become a habit, it's time to introspect. Is this habit a result of huge workload or poor time management?

One of the main reasons this can happen is that you are spending more time on activities you shouldn't like being on your phone. Not only is your phone's blue light bad for your sleeping habit, but your phone time eats away at the time you need to do other things which are more important. In the end, you have to do those anyway, so this pushes back your sleeping time.

One helpful suggestion for getting enough sleep is creating a sleep routine. Once your body gets used to going to bed and waking up at the same time, it becomes a habit. You may even realize that you don't need an alarm clock to get up any more.
