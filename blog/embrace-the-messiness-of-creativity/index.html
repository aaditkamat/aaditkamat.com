However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann&#x27;s Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I&#x27;m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to &quot;unlock&quot; your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learning"></a>Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As I&#x27;ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of &quot;connecting the dots&quot; in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="conversing"></a>Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can&#x27;t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that&#x27;s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="coding"></a>Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn&#x27;t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn&#x27;t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn&#x27;t fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That&#x27;s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren&#x27;t going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercising"></a>Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="writing"></a>Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process of rewriting</a></p><p>Even that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That&#x27;s a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="summary"></a>Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the &quot;focussed mode&quot; of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the &quot;diffused mode&quot; and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It&#x27;s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don&#x27;t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><div><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/blog/blog/2021-09-19-embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-label="Edit page"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="margin-vert--xl"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/happiness-is-success"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Happiness is success</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/it&#x27;s-ok-to-forget"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">It&#x27;s Ok To Forget Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#learning" class="table-of-contents__link">Learning</a></li><li><a href="#conversing" class="table-of-contents__link">Conversing</a></li><li><a href="#coding" class="table-of-contents__link">Coding</a></li><li><a href="#exercising" class="table-of-contents__link">Exercising</a></li><li><a href="#writing" class="table-of-contents__link">Writing</a></li><li><a href="#summary" class="table-of-contents__link">Summary</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
