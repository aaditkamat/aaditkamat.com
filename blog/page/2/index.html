The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled &quot;Memory Overload&quot;. It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn&#x27;t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven&#x27;t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn&#x27;t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer&#x27;s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer&#x27;s ideas.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-butterfly-effect">The butterfly effect</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 17, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms. </p><p>That&#x27;s why most tech companies have teams managing load balancing on their servers and perform stress testing to ensure the reliability of the systems. The engineers working in these departments inevitably have to work for longer hours or even odd hours to support systems when they eventually crash. </p><p>This is an example of how an innocuous action like posting can have a larger scale impact on the lives of others. It is perhaps captured best through the metaphor of the &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;. Such effects have probably panned out on a bigger scale to phenomena such as climate change that can be described as hyperobjects, events spanning across a large amount of space and time that are a complex intermingling of many different interactions. </p><p>We have to be kind to ourselves as a species because we are not good at predicting the future. That&#x27;s just not the way we are engineered. With time, we have evolved to set long term goals and work towards them, but we&#x27;ve to spend most of the time looking out for what lies ahead of us in the immediate future.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/taking-your-career-in-the-right-direction">Taking your career in the right direction</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 9, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In modern societies, humans spend a large amount of their time at work. By rough estimates, a human on average spends 80,000 hours in his or her career. That&#x27;s a very long time.</p><p>One of the major reasons that humans have to work is that they need to earn a livelihood. Another equally important reason, however, is that solving any problem of significant magnitude requires a considerable amount of investment of resources like time and money that only groups can pool together.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, it makes sense to pick a career that is likely to create the most impact. This is the idea behind the 80000 hours initiative affiliated with the Centre of Effective Altruism at the University of Oxford.Â </p><p>Unfortunately, people do not always have the freedom to choose the career that is best aligned with their goals. One of the reasons can be barriers to entry for a profession. But another more fundamental reason is perhaps the lack of financial freedom. </p><p>It seems as though society values money a lot, even though time may actually be even more precious than money because it is a non-renewable resource.Â That is why it is important to take the decision about your career path seriously. </p><p>That said, the best career path need not necessarily be a straight line. There is a TED talk that I came across recently which discusses the same idea. The speakers Sarah Ellis and Hellen Tupper challenge the conventional wisdom that you need to climb the career ladder to achieve success in your profession. Hence, a career needs to be evaluated from a different perspective in modern times.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-college-essential-for-success">Is college essential for success?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 8, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The learning experience in college experience is very different from the learning experience in schools. You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world">Parenting in the digital world</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 7, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this digital age, children are exposed to a vast amount of information through the internet. On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent&#x27;s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary">Is challenging the conventional wisdom always necessary?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 6, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I was listening to a conversation between Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens, the creator of the popular YouTube channel VSauce, over the Lex Fridman podcast. They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.</p><p>One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.</p><p>This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, &quot;Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty&quot;. A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/should-we-read-more-self-help-books">Should we read more self help books?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 5, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Self-help books generally encode principles that help you chart goals for your life. Once you have determined those goals, you can live life in a way that aligns with those goals. Self-help books also provide ideas that will help you improve. The improvement generally comes from within - the books primarily serve to spark motivation.</p><p>Once you start reading a couple of self-help books, you may notice some key ideas and concepts that cut across the different books. For example, as I read Cal Newport&#x27;s ideas covered in his book Deep Work through his blog, I can grasp key ideas, like building good habits and working on a limited number of things but doing them well, that help set you up for success. The importance of habits have been discussed in a couple of other self-help books as well. It seems like a part of building the &quot;Character Ethic&quot; that Stephen Covey has mentioned in his book &quot;7 Habits of Highly Successful People&quot;.</p><p>In my opinion, it is good to get an idea of what the self-help book you plan to read has to offer. This can be done by quickly analyzing the contents of the book through its chapters, summary and reviews. Read only those books that seem to resonate with you and reinforce the ideas you believe are important to incorporate in your life. The end result should be that you are able to concretely put into practice what you have learnt from the books.</p><p>If you start to read more and more self-help books, you may find yourself getting into a consumption pattern similar to reading posts from different self-help gurus on social media platforms. You feel like you learn a lot but you do not get much benefit out of the reading.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/self-help">self-help</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/importance-of-education">Importance of Education</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 4, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Education equips individuals with basic literacy skills like reading and writing.

You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn&#x27;t dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/why-we-need-to-change-our-relationship-with-technology">Why we need to change our relationship with technology</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 2, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Through the term technology, I&#x27;m referring to a range of different porducts and services that have been made available to us through scientific progress. However in recent times, this term has started to be used in a more narrow sense, to describe computers like laptops and personal computers or devices in which computers have been embedded like mobile devices. </p><p>Technology has helped improve the lives of mankind. A comfortable lifestyle is no longer accessible just to the rich and elite but also within the reach of individuals that fall in the middle-income category.</p><p>However, there are pros and cons to anything that becomes a part of our daily lives. As the American economist Herbert Simon once said, &quot;abundance of information creates a poverty of attention&quot;. The huge amount of content that is available on the internet has also become a source of distractions. Distractions prevent us from focussing on things that truly matter to us. When we end up sinking time into applications, we lose out and the businesses who have created these applications profit. </p><p>That is why it is important to change our relationship with technology. Rather than let it dictate our lives, we need to take charge of our time and attention, two of the most valuable resources we have, and use only the technologies that benefit us. This requires practicing digital minimalism: decluttering your digital life by getting rid of technologies that don&#x27;t provide value.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/technology">technology</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries Â»</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
