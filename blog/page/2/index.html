I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.</p><p>My own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="forgetting-curve">Forgetting curve<a class="hash-link" href="#forgetting-curve" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>That is because our brain has a &quot;forgetting curve&quot; just as it has a &quot;learning curve&quot;: you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.
The dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-role-of-intention">The role of intention<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-of-intention" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Your brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. </p><p>However, it&#x27;s unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-importance-of-context">The importance of context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Angela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="much-room-for-misinterpretation">Much room for misinterpretation<a class="hash-link" href="#much-room-for-misinterpretation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. </p><p>As Stephen says towards the end, &quot;My job is to write and the reader&#x27;s job is to read and forget&quot;. In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/podcasts">podcasts</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/deep-human-a-review">Deep Human - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 5, 2021</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

This becomes self-evident as we observe the people around us during the commute, glued to their mobile devices and unaware of their surroundings. </p><p>Secular mindfulness, the mindfulness techniques that are not specific to any particular religion, allow you to focus on the internal sensations of the body by observing them in a non-judgemental way.</p><p>To highlight the benefits of integrating mindfulness into your daily life, Crystal has shared the experiences of students that have taken CFG1010 who are aware of the overpowering influence of technology in their lives and how they became more attentive during the class after practising mindfulness techniques. A similar effect has been observed amongst employees who have attended group mindfulness sessions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="skill-2-self-awareness">Skill 2: Self-Awareness<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-2-self-awareness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Without self-awareness, we will not be able to regulate our emotions and understand why we behave the way we do. This can lead us to subconsciously get into negative patterns of thinking and live life on autopilot. Having great internal self-awareness allows us to have better control over the four main constituents of self: the mind, our body, our soul and spirituality. Internal self-awareness can be cultivated by practising mindfulness during different activities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="skill-3-empathy">Skill 3: Empathy<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-3-empathy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Empathy is what makes us human. It allows us to see the world from another&#x27;s perspective. When we can apply this skill successfully in our careers and our life in general, the results are magical.</p><p>There are 3 modes of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cognitive empathy</strong>: Cognitive empathy means that we can understand what the other is going through but does not necessarily mean that we share this empathy. This can be employed successfully by manipulators to read you like a book and trick you into doing what they want. This need not always be used negatively though, as doctors for example can distance themselves from the pain that the patient is going through even as they understand it very precisely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional empathy</strong>: Emotional empathy, on the other hand, means that we experience the same emotions that the other person is going through due to the &quot;mirror neurons&quot; in our brain. This is what causes us to wince in pain when we see someone hurting badly on the television, even as we are not going through the same pain ourselves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compassionate empathy</strong>: Compassionate empathy takes this a step further, where we strongly feel that we should do all we can in our power to reduce the suffering of the other person.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="skill-4-complex-communication">Skill 4: Complex Communication<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-4-complex-communication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Complex Communication is required to give the right feedback to the people we work with. This involved conveying our emotional state as accurately as we can. It is complex because we are not always aware of the inner workings of the black box that is our mind, which is influenced by different moods due to different factors such as the time of the day, the weather and the events that have taken place up to the point. When it comes to others, this gets even worse because they are even harder to read. To master this skill, we need to tap on the other skills such as self-awareness and empathy.</p><p>In place of the &quot;shit sandwich&quot; model of giving feedback: negative feedback hidden within the layers of positive feedback, which may either downplay the negative feedback or seem facetious, the authors propose the SBIFI model: Situation, Behaviour, Impact, Future, In-Group.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Situation</strong>: Focus on one specific situation to give feedback on rather than resort to generalities such as &quot;you always&quot; or &quot;you never&quot;. In general, humans are not very good at multitasking and this applies to digesting critical feedback as well. That is why focusing on one specific situation is essential for communicating what went wrong or what could be improved in a way that the person receiving feedback can take concrete action on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behaviour</strong>: Describe the person&#x27;s behaviour as precisely as you can and mention that you felt that it was inappropriate for the situation. Do not include other people in this assessment by saying &quot;All of us think that you should...&quot; because what you feel may not apply universally. </p></li><li><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Let the person know the consequences of his actions on the behaviour of others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Future</strong>: Provide feedback in a way that helps the person reflect on ways he could improve.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-Group</strong>: Share the vision and mission of the organisation and how the work done by the person fits into it.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="skill-5-adaptive-resilience">Skill 5: Adaptive Resilience<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-5-adaptive-resilience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Adaptive Resilience is perhaps one of the most important. In life, you are likely to face a lot of challenges and your success in part depends on the ability to adapt to them as well as persist through them. </p><p>To explain this concept, Crystal invokes the idea of the &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; mindset proposed by Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford. </p><p>A fixed mindset leads you to believe that you cannot change and things will mostly remain as they are. This mindset can be developed due to a person&#x27;s upbringing and personal circumstances.
A growth mindset, on the other hand, allows you to see the temporary nature of setbacks and work to learn and grow from them instead of resorting to learned helplessness. </p><p>This very much relates to the idea of growing your sphere of influence/control proposed by Stephen Covey in 7 Habits of Highly Successful People. A growth mindset may not help you succeed, as luck plays a huge role as well, but a fixed mindset is almost certain to lead to failure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="my-takeaways">My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I had first come to know Crystal and Greg Lim Lange, when I had taken the CFG1010: Roots and Wings module during the first semester of my studies at NUS. I found it a nice detour from the regular course workload that I was taking as it was non-technical and introduced concepts that were quite novel. </p><p>However, at the back of my mind, I harboured a notion that was prevalent amongst most other students in technical fields: what was needed to succeed and ultimately land the interviews that would get me my internships and my first job after college would be my technical skills and not the &quot;soft skills&quot;. Hence, I could not appreciate the wisdom behind the ideas covered in the book (a compilation of the ideas also covered in the course).</p><p>I have acquired a renewed taste in this book with each subsequent reading and this will most likely be the book that I will keep referring to at different stages of my career, to do a sort of rain check that will help me see where I am at and where I want to be. Through my own experiences, I have come to realise just how important the skills mentioned in the book truly are. </p><p>As famously said by Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who has been cited a couple of times in the book, &quot;IQ Gets You Hired, EQ Gets You Promoted&quot;. These are, I believe, so important that you should seek a role where you can hone these skills if you can, even as a job applicant.</p><p>It&#x27;s quite hard to appreciate the significance of these skills especially as an undergraduate student specializing in an academically rigorous technical field where much emphasis is still placed on the &quot;hard skills&quot;. However, you can&#x27;t just sustain with the &quot;hard skills&quot; because you need to work with others, manage your own emotions and also craft a productive lifestyle around your work in the long run.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-a-review">So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 2, 2021</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="rule-2-build-skills">Rule #2: Build Skills<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-2-build-skills" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. </p><p>To build career capital, Cal describes the necessary &quot;craftsman mindset&quot;. Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.</p><p>To build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. </p><p>Of course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="rule-3-the-importance-of-control">Rule #3: The Importance of Control<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-3-the-importance-of-control" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Through this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. </p><p>The former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don&#x27;t have a backup plan. </p><p>The second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don&#x27;t know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it&#x27;s likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission">Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>According to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="other-important-concepts">Other important concepts<a class="hash-link" href="#other-important-concepts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets.
According to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. </p><p>When you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don&#x27;t have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="my-takeaways">My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>What I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it&#x27;s hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. </p><p>I do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review">Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 28, 2021</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I had taken the popular MOOC &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot; taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn&#x27;t fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. </p><p>Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way">Increase focus the Pomodoro Way<a class="hash-link" href="#increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="get-enough-sleep">Get enough sleep<a class="hash-link" href="#get-enough-sleep" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="seperate-editing-from-writing">Seperate editing from writing<a class="hash-link" href="#seperate-editing-from-writing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="make-your-learning-active">Make your learning active<a class="hash-link" href="#make-your-learning-active" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="simulate-the-exam-conditions">Simulate the exam conditions<a class="hash-link" href="#simulate-the-exam-conditions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy">Exercise regularly and eat healthy<a class="hash-link" href="#exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="follow-the-instructions">Follow the instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#follow-the-instructions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="interleave-your-studies">Interleave your studies<a class="hash-link" href="#interleave-your-studies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test</p><p>Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system">Writing as an external data processing system</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2021</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled &quot;Memory Overload&quot;. It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn&#x27;t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven&#x27;t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn&#x27;t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer&#x27;s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer&#x27;s ideas.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/the-butterfly-effect">The butterfly effect</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 17, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

By rough estimates, a human on average spends 80,000 hours in his or her career. That&#x27;s a very long time.</p><p>One of the major reasons that humans have to work is that they need to earn a livelihood. Another equally important reason, however, is that solving any problem of significant magnitude requires a considerable amount of investment of resources like time and money that only groups can pool together.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, it makes sense to pick a career that is likely to create the most impact. This is the idea behind the 80000 hours initiative affiliated with the Centre of Effective Altruism at the University of Oxford. </p><p>Unfortunately, people do not always have the freedom to choose the career that is best aligned with their goals. One of the reasons can be barriers to entry for a profession. But another more fundamental reason is perhaps the lack of financial freedom. </p><p>It seems as though society values money a lot, even though time may actually be even more precious than money because it is a non-renewable resource. That is why it is important to take the decision about your career path seriously. </p><p>That said, the best career path need not necessarily be a straight line. There is a TED talk that I came across recently which discusses the same idea. The speakers Sarah Ellis and Hellen Tupper challenge the conventional wisdom that you need to climb the career ladder to achieve success in your profession.

You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world">Parenting in the digital world</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 7, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent&#x27;s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary">Is challenging the conventional wisdom always necessary?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 6, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.</p><p>One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.</p><p>This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, &quot;Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty&quot;. A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Aadit Kamat.
