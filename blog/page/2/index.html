You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn&#x27;t dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/why-we-need-to-change-our-relationship-with-technology">Why we need to change our relationship with technology</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 2, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Through the term technology, I&#x27;m referring to a range of different porducts and services that have been made available to us through scientific progress. However in recent times, this term has started to be used in a more narrow sense, to describe computers like laptops and personal computers or devices in which computers have been embedded like mobile devices. </p><p>Technology has helped improve the lives of mankind. A comfortable lifestyle is no longer accessible just to the rich and elite but also within the reach of individuals that fall in the middle-income category.</p><p>However, there are pros and cons to anything that becomes a part of our daily lives. As the American economist Herbert Simon once said, &quot;abundance of information creates a poverty of attention&quot;. The huge amount of content that is available on the internet has also become a source of distractions. Distractions prevent us from focussing on things that truly matter to us. When we end up sinking time into applications, we lose out and the businesses who have created these applications profit. </p><p>That is why it is important to change our relationship with technology. Rather than let it dictate our lives, we need to take charge of our time and attention, two of the most valuable resources we have, and use only the technologies that benefit us. This requires practicing digital minimalism: decluttering your digital life by getting rid of technologies that don&#x27;t provide value.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/technology">technology</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/sticking-to-an-exercise-routine">Sticking to an exercise routine</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 1, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>For the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been trying to build an exercise habit. I usually get up around 6 in the morning. While I initially started with just Yoga exercises in the morning, I realized that I can make better use of my time by doing HIIT workouts first and then doing Yoga as part of the cool down routine.</p><p>An important requirement for getting started with an exercise routine and sticking with it is motivation. Why put in all that effort to grind it out, when you could easily be doing something else, like staying in bed longer or watching Netflix? My motivation behind building an exercise habit was improving my physical health. My full-time role as a QA Engineer requires me to sit down in front of my laptop and monitor for longer hours than I was used to as a student. It&#x27;s very easy for me to become a couch potato if I don&#x27;t work out. Exercising on a daily basis helps me counter the effects of sitting down on the work desk for longer periods of time.</p><p>Settling into an exercise routine teaches you the importance of sticking to a habit. As a reward loop is essential for habit formation, you need to create an incentive after you have completed a workout. That way, when you feel like quitting once the going gets tough, you at least have that incentive to look forward to. For me, that incentive is the healthy breakfast that follows my workout.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/sports-exemplifies-the-human-spirit">Sports exemplifies the human spirit</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 30, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I generally don&#x27;t watch that much sports, but it&#x27;s the Olympics season so I wanted to catch some of the action. As I switch on the channel broadcasting the Olympics only after work ends at 7 pm, I was only able to watch the swimming event.</p><p>It was amazing to see how the athletes, so lithe and graceful in their movements, rugged in physique, competing down to the wire.</p><p>As a Singaporean, I was looking forward to the 100m and 200m Butterfly heats where the participants from Singapore, Zheng Wen Quah and Joseph Schooling were competing to qualify for the semi finals. A lot of hopes rested on the shoulders of Joseph Schooling in particular, who had broken the Olympic Record during his gold medal run in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>Unfortunately, both of them did not manage to qualify. To make matters worse, Joseph Schooling was the last one to finish the race amongst the participants in his section. The disappointment did not sink in until the next day as I read Rohit Brijnath&#x27;s article in the Straits TImes on Joseph&#x27;s showing.</p><p>To me, Olympics is a treat to watch not only because of the intensity of the competition but because I can see the principles of hard work and perservance so clearly demonstrated during the live event. This year&#x27;s event was especially challenging one thanks to COVID-19. Even if only a few would go on to qualify and only 3 would bag medals, it is a great accomplishment just to be able to compete at the Olympics. Being able to shrug off the defeat and move on is a testament to the indomitable human spirit as wins and losses are a part and parcel of sports.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/sports">sports</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift">The Power Of Music To Uplift</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 29, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack &amp; Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.</p><p>As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.</p><p>Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.</p><p>You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That&#x27;s where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.</p><p>To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-state-of-happiness">The State of Happiness</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 28, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It appears as though every human being on this planet ultimately seeks to be happy. As most of us will be aware through our personal experiences though, it is impossible to achieve everlasting happiness. Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.</p><p>It is hard to quantify happiness, since happiness is a state of the mind. Also, happiness is relative. You are likely to feel happier on days when your mood is uplifted or even normal as compared to days when you have gone through a rough patch.</p><p>There are different sources of happiness. Some find happiness in their work. Some find happiness through connecting with their loved ones. Others find happiness through gaining wealth and other materialistic possessions.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the happiest people are those that are the most wealthy. However, money can also be a source of stress. The rich are often unsure whether the friends they have are true friends or merely friends of their money. Studies measuring the happiness quotient also seem to indicate that happiness tends to increase with income levels but only uptil an inflection point, where the curve then tapers off.</p><p>In my opinion, the happiest people are the ones who are able to remain focussed on the present instead of worrying excessively about what the future holds or remaining stuck with the regrets of the past. They are able to manage their expectations realistically and maintain a healthy balance between their social and work lives.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/why-do-we-have-regrets">Why do we have regrets?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 27, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Youngsters like me are always on a look out for advice that can help us make the best use of our time and set ourselves up for the future. Advice from elders are usually packed with insights. They wish to convey information that they think is important for us youngsters to know. This way we don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel and go through the same struggles they did.</p><p>Sometimes, I also find a tinge of regret hidden in the advice. The alternate paths they could have taken but did not, either due to their own inhibitions or due to the circumstances, are often the cause for this regret.</p><p>As a result, I posed myself this question: Why do we have regrets? To me, it seems quite natural for us humans to feel disappointed if things don&#x27;t work out as well as expected, especially since opportunities abound in the modern world and there are multiple paths to success. In such a case, doing a cost benefit analysis to prune out unfavourable paths seems like a pragmatic approach that also makes you feel more empowered.</p><p>However, it is infeasible to attach an opportunity cost to each decision. It fools you into boiling down life into an accountancy game, whereas life is complex.</p><p>This line of reasoning may help you rationalize your regrets: with the resources and knowledge available at the time, the decisions you took were the best you could have taken. It is easy to connect the dots in hindsight, but that&#x27;s due to our hindsight bias.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/working-9-to-5">Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living!</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 26, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>As a child, I never considered what it would be like to work regular hours in an office job. This is something that I took for granted. However, now as a fresh graduate who has stepped into the working world, I have been thinking more about how a 9-to-5 job seems to have almost become a rite of passage since the Industrial Age.</p><p>To be fair, there are different types of occupations in modern society. Hence, not everyone really works regular hours during a designated work week. Some employees are required to work on night shifts or alternate full day shifts, while others may have flexible working hours.</p><p>However, as more industries are pivoting towards regular hours, it&#x27;s important to ask this question: should companies revise their working schedules or continue to stick to the status quo? I believe that is it best if the management of a company can assess its own situation holistically and follow what works best for the organisation as a whole, rather than having to follow what is the agreed upon norm for the insustry. As demonstrated in the case of Iceland, where companies are moving toward four day work weeks, governments also have an important role to play. Going forward, this will be seen as an essential component of employee welfare. There isn&#x27;t a one size fits all approach to this dilemma, but an approach that adapts as per the demands of different roles. Companies will need to find workarounds that preserve the integrity of the organisation if different groups of employees have different working hours.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/rising-up-after-failure">Rising up after failure</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-25T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 25, 2021 Â· One min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>This afternoon, as I was watching the videos for a React Native course on Udemy, I came across an image that I found quite inspirational. In this image, success has been described in terms of an iceberg illusion. A success story is like the tip of an iceberg. When you hear about it, you are exposed to only one portion, the portion that worked right, but are unaware of what&#x27;s hidden beneath. Those hidden portions of the story, such as the sacrifices made by the individual, the perseverance despite setbacks, and the determination to forge ahead are left out either because it&#x27;s easy to forget them when you reflect on the story retrospectively or because they do not appear glamorous enough.</p><p>The human journey is beset with failures. Some will feel minor, like bumps on an otherwise smooth road, while others can be major setbacks. As a human, it is natural to experience dejection after you face failures, especially if they keep coming.  The mistakes you make during failures are often alternate paths towards your goals and you find the right path only after several iterations. Learning from those mistakes is what helps us improve and grow.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/power-of-habit">Power of Habit</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 24, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Try to think of all the things you do when you wake up in the morning: brush your teeth, take a morning shower, catch up on the news, eat breakfast. How many of these things do you do consciously and how many of them have become a part of your routine? An introspection of our daily routines makes us realise how much of our lifestyle is habitual, built up over a long time.</p><p>Habits can be both good and bad. Tapping into insights from neuroscience can help you undo those habits that do not benefit you and create new ones that will help enrich your life. The actions required to carry out these tasks, no matter how complex, get recorded in a region of our long-term memory known as the Basal Ganglia. As a result, we can fetch the information required for these tasks effortlessly from our brain. </p><p>One of the key elements of developing any habit is practice. For the actions to be stored in our memory effectively, we need to be able to repeat them a sufficient number of times. Another important element of developing a habit is to create a positive reward loop around it. Thinking of how the habit fits into the long term picture will help you stick with it when the going gets tough. Last but not the least, have a plan of action for how you will go about forming the habit and what you will do if that does not work out. This will also help build up the resilience that is needed for habit formation.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries Â»</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
