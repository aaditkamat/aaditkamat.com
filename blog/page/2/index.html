This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-2-build-skills"></a>Rule #2: Build Skills<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-2-build-skills" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. </p><p>To build career capital, Cal describes the necessary &quot;craftsman mindset&quot;. Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.</p><p>To build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. </p><p>Of course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-3-the-importance-of-control"></a>Rule #3: The Importance of Control<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-3-the-importance-of-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Through this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. </p><p>The former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don&#x27;t have a backup plan. </p><p>The second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don&#x27;t know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it&#x27;s likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission"></a>Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>According to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="other-important-concepts"></a>Other important concepts<a class="hash-link" href="#other-important-concepts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets.
According to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. </p><p>When you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don&#x27;t have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="my-takeaways"></a>My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it&#x27;s hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. </p><p>I do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review">Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 28, 2021 Â· 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro</a></p><p>Even though I have graduated from college, I felt that it was necessary for me to read this book to become an effective lifelong learner. I had taken the popular MOOC &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot; taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn&#x27;t fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. </p><p>Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way"></a>Increase focus the Pomodoro Way<a class="hash-link" href="#increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="get-enough-sleep"></a>Get enough sleep<a class="hash-link" href="#get-enough-sleep" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="seperate-editing-from-writing"></a>Seperate editing from writing<a class="hash-link" href="#seperate-editing-from-writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="make-your-learning-active"></a>Make your learning active<a class="hash-link" href="#make-your-learning-active" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="simulate-the-exam-conditions"></a>Simulate the exam conditions<a class="hash-link" href="#simulate-the-exam-conditions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy"></a>Exercise regularly and eat healthy<a class="hash-link" href="#exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="follow-the-instructions"></a>Follow the instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#follow-the-instructions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="interleave-your-studies"></a>Interleave your studies<a class="hash-link" href="#interleave-your-studies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test</p><p>Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system">Writing as an external data processing system</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 19, 2021 Â· 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>As I started to think more about writing online, I often wondered to myself about how people would write before the printing press was invented. The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled &quot;Memory Overload&quot;. It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn&#x27;t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven&#x27;t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn&#x27;t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer&#x27;s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer&#x27;s ideas.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-butterfly-effect">The butterfly effect</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 17, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms. </p><p>That&#x27;s why most tech companies have teams managing load balancing on their servers and perform stress testing to ensure the reliability of the systems. The engineers working in these departments inevitably have to work for longer hours or even odd hours to support systems when they eventually crash. </p><p>This is an example of how an innocuous action like posting can have a larger scale impact on the lives of others. It is perhaps captured best through the metaphor of the &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;. Such effects have probably panned out on a bigger scale to phenomena such as climate change that can be described as hyperobjects, events spanning across a large amount of space and time that are a complex intermingling of many different interactions. </p><p>We have to be kind to ourselves as a species because we are not good at predicting the future. That&#x27;s just not the way we are engineered. With time, we have evolved to set long term goals and work towards them, but we&#x27;ve to spend most of the time looking out for what lies ahead of us in the immediate future.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/taking-your-career-in-the-right-direction">Taking your career in the right direction</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 9, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In modern societies, humans spend a large amount of their time at work. By rough estimates, a human on average spends 80,000 hours in his or her career. That&#x27;s a very long time.</p><p>One of the major reasons that humans have to work is that they need to earn a livelihood. Another equally important reason, however, is that solving any problem of significant magnitude requires a considerable amount of investment of resources like time and money that only groups can pool together.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, it makes sense to pick a career that is likely to create the most impact. This is the idea behind the 80000 hours initiative affiliated with the Centre of Effective Altruism at the University of Oxford.Â </p><p>Unfortunately, people do not always have the freedom to choose the career that is best aligned with their goals. One of the reasons can be barriers to entry for a profession. But another more fundamental reason is perhaps the lack of financial freedom. </p><p>It seems as though society values money a lot, even though time may actually be even more precious than money because it is a non-renewable resource.Â That is why it is important to take the decision about your career path seriously. </p><p>That said, the best career path need not necessarily be a straight line. There is a TED talk that I came across recently which discusses the same idea. The speakers Sarah Ellis and Hellen Tupper challenge the conventional wisdom that you need to climb the career ladder to achieve success in your profession. Hence, a career needs to be evaluated from a different perspective in modern times.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-college-essential-for-success">Is college essential for success?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 8, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The learning experience in college experience is very different from the learning experience in schools. You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world">Parenting in the digital world</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 7, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this digital age, children are exposed to a vast amount of information through the internet. On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent&#x27;s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary">Is challenging the conventional wisdom always necessary?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 6, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I was listening to a conversation between Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens, the creator of the popular YouTube channel VSauce, over the Lex Fridman podcast. They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.</p><p>One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.</p><p>This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, &quot;Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty&quot;. A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/should-we-read-more-self-help-books">Should we read more self help books?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 5, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Self-help books generally encode principles that help you chart goals for your life. Once you have determined those goals, you can live life in a way that aligns with those goals. Self-help books also provide ideas that will help you improve. The improvement generally comes from within - the books primarily serve to spark motivation.</p><p>Once you start reading a couple of self-help books, you may notice some key ideas and concepts that cut across the different books. For example, as I read Cal Newport&#x27;s ideas covered in his book Deep Work through his blog, I can grasp key ideas, like building good habits and working on a limited number of things but doing them well, that help set you up for success. The importance of habits have been discussed in a couple of other self-help books as well. It seems like a part of building the &quot;Character Ethic&quot; that Stephen Covey has mentioned in his book &quot;7 Habits of Highly Successful People&quot;.</p><p>In my opinion, it is good to get an idea of what the self-help book you plan to read has to offer. This can be done by quickly analyzing the contents of the book through its chapters, summary and reviews. Read only those books that seem to resonate with you and reinforce the ideas you believe are important to incorporate in your life. The end result should be that you are able to concretely put into practice what you have learnt from the books.</p><p>If you start to read more and more self-help books, you may find yourself getting into a consumption pattern similar to reading posts from different self-help gurus on social media platforms. You feel like you learn a lot but you do not get much benefit out of the reading.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/self-help">self-help</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/importance-of-education">Importance of Education</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 4, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Education equips individuals with basic literacy skills like reading and writing. While the primary aim of modern education is to help students develop a set of core competencies or &quot;hard skills&quot;, it also helps them furnish soft skills like communication and teamwork that are becoming more and more critical in the workplace.</p><p>The value of education is intrinsic: you simply cannot judge the value of education by looking at the return of investment. This is because, you cannot pre-emptively determine how your learning in prior years will become relevant later on in life.</p><p>Education enhances the quality of your mind. Having a well-developed mind is essential for developing the cognitive abilities needed to make sense of the vast array of information we are exposed to in the current times.</p><p>Many of the problems in the current education systems around the world arise due to an over emphasis on testing and grades. Teachers are obligated to complete the topics within the curriculum on time. To ensure that students are learning at the right pace, they have to assign homework. Sometimes, the amount of homework assigned becomes too much and this leaves the student less time to engage with other activities that are important for their development. It is important to re-evaluate current education models so that we can achieve a right balance and make education more holistic.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries Â»</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
