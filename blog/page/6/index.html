Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I first started coding in 11th Standard when I took up a course on Computer Science, at the age of 16. I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn’t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn’t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I’d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor’s and Master’s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn’t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn’t need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I’d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the “sink or swim” methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren’t running an “Apple Genius Bar” service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven’t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through <a href="https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Spittel’s tips to beginners</a>, as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/getting-my-moderna-shots">Getting My Moderna Shots</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 20, 2021</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

12 to 39</a>
could register interest to sign up for vaccine appointments by filling in
their particulars in a <a href="https://preregister.vaccine.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple registration form.</a></p><p>As my parents had already gotten vaccinated, I filled up this form as soon
as I could. After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to
provide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at
one of the <a href="https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinics or vaccination centers</a> for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have
been given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to
receive this SMS.</p><p>Another thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for
booking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I
believe that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered
to the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer
vaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher efficacy</a> and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milder side-effects</a>.</p><p>However, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the
Moderna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as
compared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting
my shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore
Government is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to
get their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the
population vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up,
as evidenced by examples of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other developed nations reopening,
particularly in the West</a>.</p><p>I&#x27;m glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination.
Thankfully, I did not experience any of the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms mentioned in the
information sheet</a>, so I left immediately after the observation period was over. </p><p>Upon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also
received two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my
family has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they
were being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise
caution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from
the Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.</p><p>I would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug
allergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about
whether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug
allergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with
the ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice:
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moderna</a> or <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pfizer</a>. Rest assured, you will be asked the required
questions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well
as before you take the vaccine.</p><p>Before you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it&#x27;s easier to roll them up as you get your shot.</p><p>With this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, I&#x27;m feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/covid-19">covid-19</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/vaccines">vaccines</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/how-you-can-approach-a-leetcode-problem">How You Can Approach a LeetCode Problem</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 16, 2020</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Dynamic Programming problems in particular trip me up a lot.

This kind of an approach seems very similar to that required for solving Competitive Programming problems, where you are given the constraints on the inputs and outputs and you try to go for the most optimal solution that is not only efficient in terms of the order of time and space complexity i.e. the complexity of the solution expressed in the Big-O notation, but in terms of the limits imposed by the platform.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iXpPNZ0mu44gyJtomvg0lA.png" alt="Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem </figcaption></figure><p>Instead, I like to think of a LeetCode problem as it would more or less appear in an interview. Yes, you don’t have an interviewer with you to help clarify your doubts, but you can take note of them before you go ahead with designing a solution. It’s even better if you use LeetCode problems as you conduct mock interviews with your friends, since your friend can play the role of an interviewer. Start by looking through the problem statement and examples, then <b>write down your assumptions.</b></p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*S2BtsRUSVK1b7ZQsEuAjXw.png" alt="Problem constraints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem constraints </figcaption></figure><p>You should ideally do this even <b>before you look at the problem constraints</b>. This is because interviewers tend to pose the interview problem with slight ambiguity in order to give candidates the opportunity to ask for additional clarification. As a result, they would not generally start by specifying the problem constraints.</p><p>Once you have written down your assumptions about the problem, go ahead and check with the constraints of the problems to see if those assumptions are met. If they do, then that’s great. Otherwise, you may get additional insight about the kind of edge cases that you may have missed out on.</p><p>Once you have clarified your doubts and checked your assumptions, <b>try to come up with a brute force solution and not search for the most optimal solution at first</b>. For easy problems, this will usually work. However, even for the harder problems, coming up with something that at least works is better than nothing. Also, this brute force solution gives you an opportunity to discuss why this solution is inefficient and may serve as a guide to a better solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*P0Nhu_AfJ8fbeSSUDbIU2g.png" alt="Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints </figcaption></figure><p>The next step now is to optimize your brute force solution. This is often done with the help of some data structures or algorithmic patterns. If you are stuck at this stage, you can look at the Related Topics and Hints (if available) sections of the problem. This is sort of the equivalent of asking an interviewer for a hint. From what I know, most interviewers are ok with giving hints as long as you have explained your approach thus far and where you are stuck. If your interviewers are nice enough, they may be willing to help you out but don’t go about solving a problem with that assumption.</p><p>Hopefully, looking at those sections has given you a fair idea for an optimized solution. Once you have done that, take out your whiteboard (or if you are like me and don’t have a whiteboard, use pen and paper instead) and go about writing your solution over there. Trust me, the experience of “whiteboard coding” is much different from using an editor, not only because you miss out on the syntax highlighting and code completion, but also the core editing features such as copy and paste.</p><p>Once you have done that, run your solution through a couple of cases, which should be a mix of the given examples (for sanity check) and some other cases, including edge cases, that you have identified when you came up with the assumptions. Make sure you do this manually and not using the LeetCode console at first. This allows you to spot the bugs in your code and address the problems in your solution. This also saves you from having to edit your solution multiple times.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Rf4ufh6V7-3MQ0ozLH1NaA.png" alt="A solution with time and space complexity specified" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> A solution with time and space complexity specified </figcaption></figure><p>Once you are confident that your code works and is efficient to the best of your knowledge, write down the time and space complexity for your proposed solution. This way, you have a clear metric to demonstrate how the current solution is better than your previous solution and also discuss the tradeoffs should you have any alternate approaches.</p><p>Now that you have tried everything you possibly could to get to the best solution, it’s time to test your code with the cases that you have come up with. LeetCode premium users can make use of the debugger, but in my opinion, it’s best to stick to the console. This is because it is unlikely that you would be allowed to use a debugger for a real interview question. If you get an error for a particular case then try to go through solution again manually. If that still does not help you, you have no choice but to use logging techniques to debug your solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Discussion section for the sample problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Discussion section for the sample problem </figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Official solution for another problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center">Official solution for another problem</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, after all this hard work, if all your test cases have passed, just go ahead and submit your solution! If the solution has been accepted, well done. You can go ahead and post your solution in the Discuss section. You can also check out what others have posted or even have a look at the official solutions if they have been provided. Otherwise, you can see what test case has failed and address the problem(s) in your solution.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to work on the problem again from scratch. Chances are that you would have a fresh approach to look at the problem and that might do the trick! It’s important to remember that you learn from incorrect solutions as much (if not more) as you learn from the correct solutions.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coding">coding</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interviews">interviews</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
