You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world">Parenting in the digital world</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 7, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent&#x27;s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/is-challenging-the-conventional-wisdom-always-necessary">Is challenging the conventional wisdom always necessary?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 6, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.</p><p>One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.</p><p>This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, &quot;Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty&quot;. A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/should-we-read-more-self-help-books">Should we read more self help books?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 5, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Once you have determined those goals, you can live life in a way that aligns with those goals. Self-help books also provide ideas that will help you improve. The improvement generally comes from within - the books primarily serve to spark motivation.</p><p>Once you start reading a couple of self-help books, you may notice some key ideas and concepts that cut across the different books. For example, as I read Cal Newport&#x27;s ideas covered in his book Deep Work through his blog, I can grasp key ideas, like building good habits and working on a limited number of things but doing them well, that help set you up for success. The importance of habits have been discussed in a couple of other self-help books as well. It seems like a part of building the &quot;Character Ethic&quot; that Stephen Covey has mentioned in his book &quot;7 Habits of Highly Successful People&quot;.</p><p>In my opinion, it is good to get an idea of what the self-help book you plan to read has to offer. This can be done by quickly analyzing the contents of the book through its chapters, summary and reviews. Read only those books that seem to resonate with you and reinforce the ideas you believe are important to incorporate in your life. The end result should be that you are able to concretely put into practice what you have learnt from the books.</p><p>If you start to read more and more self-help books, you may find yourself getting into a consumption pattern similar to reading posts from different self-help gurus on social media platforms. You feel like you learn a lot but you do not get much benefit out of the reading.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/self-help">self-help</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/importance-of-education">Importance of Education</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 4, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

While the primary aim of modern education is to help students develop a set of core competencies or &quot;hard skills&quot;, it also helps them furnish soft skills like communication and teamwork that are becoming more and more critical in the workplace.</p><p>The value of education is intrinsic: you simply cannot judge the value of education by looking at the return of investment. This is because, you cannot pre-emptively determine how your learning in prior years will become relevant later on in life.</p><p>Education enhances the quality of your mind. Having a well-developed mind is essential for developing the cognitive abilities needed to make sense of the vast array of information we are exposed to in the current times.</p><p>Many of the problems in the current education systems around the world arise due to an over emphasis on testing and grades. Teachers are obligated to complete the topics within the curriculum on time. To ensure that students are learning at the right pace, they have to assign homework. Sometimes, the amount of homework assigned becomes too much and this leaves the student less time to engage with other activities that are important for their development. It is important to re-evaluate current education models so that we can achieve a right balance and make education more holistic.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/staying-focussed-amidst-distractions">Staying focussed amidst distractions</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 3, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn&#x27;t dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/why-we-need-to-change-our-relationship-with-technology">Why we need to change our relationship with technology</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 2, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

However in recent times, this term has started to be used in a more narrow sense, to describe computers like laptops and personal computers or devices in which computers have been embedded like mobile devices. </p><p>Technology has helped improve the lives of mankind. A comfortable lifestyle is no longer accessible just to the rich and elite but also within the reach of individuals that fall in the middle-income category.</p><p>However, there are pros and cons to anything that becomes a part of our daily lives. As the American economist Herbert Simon once said, &quot;abundance of information creates a poverty of attention&quot;. The huge amount of content that is available on the internet has also become a source of distractions. Distractions prevent us from focussing on things that truly matter to us. When we end up sinking time into applications, we lose out and the businesses who have created these applications profit. </p><p>That is why it is important to change our relationship with technology. Rather than let it dictate our lives, we need to take charge of our time and attention, two of the most valuable resources we have, and use only the technologies that benefit us. This requires practicing digital minimalism: decluttering your digital life by getting rid of technologies that don&#x27;t provide value.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/technology">technology</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/sticking-to-an-exercise-routine">Sticking to an exercise routine</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 1, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I usually get up around 6 in the morning. While I initially started with just Yoga exercises in the morning, I realized that I can make better use of my time by doing HIIT workouts first and then doing Yoga as part of the cool down routine.</p><p>An important requirement for getting started with an exercise routine and sticking with it is motivation. Why put in all that effort to grind it out, when you could easily be doing something else, like staying in bed longer or watching Netflix? My motivation behind building an exercise habit was improving my physical health. My full-time role as a QA Engineer requires me to sit down in front of my laptop and monitor for longer hours than I was used to as a student. It&#x27;s very easy for me to become a couch potato if I don&#x27;t work out. Exercising on a daily basis helps me counter the effects of sitting down on the work desk for longer periods of time.</p><p>Settling into an exercise routine teaches you the importance of sticking to a habit. As a reward loop is essential for habit formation, you need to create an incentive after you have completed a workout. That way, when you feel like quitting once the going gets tough, you at least have that incentive to look forward to. For me, that incentive is the healthy breakfast that follows my workout.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/sports-exemplifies-the-human-spirit">Sports exemplifies the human spirit</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 30, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

As I switch on the channel broadcasting the Olympics only after work ends at 7 pm, I was only able to watch the swimming event.</p><p>It was amazing to see how the athletes, so lithe and graceful in their movements, rugged in physique, competing down to the wire.</p><p>As a Singaporean, I was looking forward to the 100m and 200m Butterfly heats where the participants from Singapore, Zheng Wen Quah and Joseph Schooling were competing to qualify for the semi finals. A lot of hopes rested on the shoulders of Joseph Schooling in particular, who had broken the Olympic Record during his gold medal run in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>Unfortunately, both of them did not manage to qualify. To make matters worse, Joseph Schooling was the last one to finish the race amongst the participants in his section. The disappointment did not sink in until the next day as I read Rohit Brijnath&#x27;s article in the Straits TImes on Joseph&#x27;s showing.</p><p>To me, Olympics is a treat to watch not only because of the intensity of the competition but because I can see the principles of hard work and perservance so clearly demonstrated during the live event. This year&#x27;s event was especially challenging one thanks to COVID-19. Even if only a few would go on to qualify and only 3 would bag medals, it is a great accomplishment just to be able to compete at the Olympics. Being able to shrug off the defeat and move on is a testament to the indomitable human spirit as wins and losses are a part and parcel of sports.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sports">sports</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift">The Power Of Music To Uplift</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 29, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.</p><p>As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.</p><p>Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.</p><p>You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That&#x27;s where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.</p><p>To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
