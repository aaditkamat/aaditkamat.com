While some such as the Morning Brew are important for me to catch up with the news for the day, others just don&#x27;t provide me as much value as I had expected when I first signed up for them. I am particularly annoyed by the newsletters that I get from different companies informing me about their latest events or products and services starting to get a little annoying. Yes Apple, I&#x27;m talking about all those emails you have sent me for the 1-year Apple TV+ subscription or the 6 months free Apple Music subscription that I absolutely do not need at this point.</p><p>As I seek a minimalist digital lifestyle, it&#x27;s important for me to unsubscribe from all those newsletters that I find clogging up my inbox. While this task has become more difficult as I&#x27;ve unwittingly ended up inviting emails from a lot of different service providers over time, either by opting for the newsletters knowingly or doing so unknowingly while registering for an account, there are online tools like Unroll.me and clean.email that have come to my aid to clear up my inbox.</p><p>I believe that having a clean inbox is a significant productivity boost because it helps you declutter your mind and focus only on those emails that truly matter. Overflowing email has acquired the proportions of a first-world problem that many of us face in this digital age, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be a nightmare. Make sure you take some time out this weekend to attend to this chore, so you don&#x27;t have to stress out about it when you get back to work.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/is-overpopulation-really-a-major-crisis">Is Overpopulation really a major crisis?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 14, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I remember discussing this issue with a relative who brought up the point about how the population has grown from less than a billion in the 1800s to a whopping figure of 7.9 billion, quadrupling over the last century. </p><p>He described it as the elephant in the room, the issue that was not being discussed with as much fervour as say climate change. A growing population meant more mouths to feed and this would eventually place constraints on governments who have to cater to the demands of the populace. </p><p>In particular, he mentioned how the progress that India had made in terms of GDP growth seemed to be evened out by the population growth. In view of these issues, the efforts made by governments to tackle population growth such as China&#x27;s former one-child policy and the two-child policy now being promoted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India seem more than welcome.</p><p>Watching a Kurzgesagt video on overpopulation however, changed my perspective on it. Instead of focussing on the doom and gloom that is generally associated with a burgeoning population, the video addressed the trends in demographic transition that have emerged in developing countries like Bangladesh, which mirror those that had been seen in the now-developed countries like Britain post-industrialisation. </p><p>Due to improvements in healthcare, growing life spans and more educated citizens, the birth rates have started to decline and the population growth has more or less stabilised. This paints a more positive picture of the road ahead, if other countries lagging behind begin to follow this trend, with help from the developed countries.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/a-minimalistic-approach-to-our-digital-lives">A minimalistic approach to our digital lives</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Having access to such a large amount of information at our fingertips gives us the impression that we are becoming smarter. But are we really? Or is all that information confusing us instead?</p><p>In a recent conversation with a friend, I shared with her why I had decided to limit my social media usage. </p><p>One of the reasons why I did so is because I noticed that my relationship with social media had started to change in college and took a turn for the worst after the pandemic. Another reason that inspired to me to make this change was an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science professor at the Georgetown University who writes about the intersection of tech and culture. He advocates quitting social media altogether and emphasises the need for digital minimalism required for to do &quot;deep work&quot;, or long periods of focused work with minimal distractions.</p><p>I know that it&#x27;s impractical for a lot of people to quit social media altogether, especially those whose work relies heavily on it. I find Newport&#x27;s watered down stance more useful in this regard: Spend some time away from your devices to reassess your relationship with technology. Pick the tools that are in alignment with your goals. </p><p>The way I see it, this will establish a bottom up relationship with technology driven by personal needs rather than a top down relationship where you end up adding more apps that seem useful but just aren&#x27;t.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/are-we-living-in-a-simulation">Are we living in a simulation?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 12, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It&#x27;s how we as a human society have reached where we are right now, achieving technological progress at an ever-accelerating pace, that has perplexed me.</p><p>I&#x27;m a theist but I&#x27;ve not really subscribed to one religious view completely, even as a practicing Hindu. I used to conceptualise God as a supernatural force that permeates the very fabric of the cosmos. </p><p>Now though, the idea that we may be living in a simulation opens up entertaining possibilities. Are we characters being controlled by players of an arcade game? Are we a hive mind that is being controlled by a computer? Or perhaps all of this has originated in a single mind that has been coerced to live in a dream?</p><p>Of course, none of the questions I have posed here are novel. In fact, they have been inspired from popular fiction such as the Matrix, Bladerunner, the Truman Show and Dark City that has delved into this topic. However, my personal beliefs have been reinforced as I view the world around me, whose many aspects I used to take for granted earlier. </p><p>For those interested to learn more about this topic, I&#x27;d recommend reading the seminal paper on the Simulation Hypothesis authored by Nick Bostrom and a book with a similar title written by Rizwan Virk, a former MIT graduate student and professional game developer.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/an-assessment-of-the-role-of-money-in-modern-society">An assessment of the role of money in modern society</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 11, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

As history goes, different forms of money have evolved from the barter system where one person, the buyer, offers goods or services to the other person, the seller in return for goods or services of equivalent value. </p><p>For such a system to succeed, there are two key requirements that must be met. First, both parties involved must be fairly acquainted with each other for the exchange to take place. Second, the exchange must mutually benefit them in a way that they perceive as being of equivalent value. </p><p>As one can see, such a system quickly becomes cumbersome and unsustainable over time. Hence, it was necessary for humans to come up with a replacement that would allow people to transact without having these two key requirements in place.</p><p>Today, money plays that role since the buyer does not need to provide anything of material value to the seller apart from monetary payment. In return the buyer is expected to participate in the economy through some way, typically through the employment, where he ends up providing a valuable good or service to others in the company in which he is employed or to consumers directly if he is self-employed. </p><p>There are exceptions to this rule, but the engine of modern economy treads forward when the balance is maintained, as the supply meets the demand.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/stop-comparing-yourself-with-others">Stop comparing yourself with others</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 10, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Angela said that it is important to evaluate the tendency to compare from an evolutionary psychology standpoint. </p><p>Humans tend to compare their lives with lives of those who seem to be doing better because they wish to improve their lives. This is known as upward social comparison. This can be positive if the person does not get discouraged by others&#x27; accomplishments, but tends to have detrimental effects on the person&#x27;s mental health if done too often.</p><p>On the other hand, a person may also experience schadenfreude, taking joy at someone&#x27;s suffering. This is an example of downward social comparison. It rarely brings any benefit, since it does not improve the person&#x27;s own wellbeing and may make the person feel guilty for experiencing such emotions instead.</p><p>I would conclude by saying that everyone needs to introspect and control this tendency if it is harming them. This is easier said than done, but you can only grow as a person if you seek to improve by competing with yourself, not with others.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/advice-to-my-former-self">What you should know as an undergraduate student - advice to my former self</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 9, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

These are the four things that I wish I had known as an undergraduate student back in college.</p><p>First, I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten into the rat race to achieve stellar grades or bag prestigious internships at the top companies, just out of peer pressure. As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I&#x27;d instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they&#x27;d likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.</p><p>Second, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.</p><p>Third, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.</p><p>Last, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual&#x27;s perspective. People will always have some regrets when they reflect back upon their college days. So take this advice with a pinch of salt and enjoy the college journey while you can!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/my-journey-to-becoming-a-developer">My journey to becoming a developer</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 4, 2021</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I first started coding in 11th Standard when I took up a course on Computer Science, at the age of 16. I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn’t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn’t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I’d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor’s and Master’s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn’t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn’t need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I’d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the “sink or swim” methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren’t running an “Apple Genius Bar” service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven’t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through <a href="https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Spittel’s tips to beginners</a>, as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/getting-my-moderna-shots">Getting My Moderna Shots</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 20, 2021</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It was announced on 11th June in Singapore that <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-aged-12-to-39-can-book-vaccination-appointments-from-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those in the age group of
12 to 39</a>
could register interest to sign up for vaccine appointments by filling in
their particulars in a <a href="https://preregister.vaccine.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple registration form.</a></p><p>As my parents had already gotten vaccinated, I filled up this form as soon
as I could. After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to
provide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at
one of the <a href="https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinics or vaccination centers</a> for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have
been given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to
receive this SMS.</p><p>Another thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for
booking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I
believe that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered
to the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer
vaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher efficacy</a> and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milder side-effects</a>.</p><p>However, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the
Moderna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as
compared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting
my shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore
Government is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to
get their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the
population vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up,
as evidenced by examples of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other developed nations reopening,
particularly in the West</a>.</p><p>I&#x27;m glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination.
Thankfully, I did not experience any of the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms mentioned in the
information sheet</a>, so I left immediately after the observation period was over. </p><p>Upon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also
received two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my
family has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they
were being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise
caution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from
the Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.</p><p>I would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug
allergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about
whether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug
allergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with
the ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice:
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moderna</a> or <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pfizer</a>. Rest assured, you will be asked the required
questions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well
as before you take the vaccine.</p><p>Before you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it&#x27;s easier to roll them up as you get your shot.</p><p>With this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, I&#x27;m feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/covid-19">covid-19</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/vaccines">vaccines</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
