I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn‚Äôt used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn‚Äôt spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I‚Äôd also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn‚Äôt sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn‚Äôt know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn‚Äôt need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I‚Äôd like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the ‚Äúsink or swim‚Äù methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren‚Äôt running an ‚ÄúApple Genius Bar‚Äù service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven‚Äôt yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through <a href="https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Spittel‚Äôs tips to beginners</a>, as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/getting-my-moderna-shots">Getting My Moderna Shots</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">June 20, 2021 ¬∑ 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It was announced on 11th June in Singapore that <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-aged-12-to-39-can-book-vaccination-appointments-from-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those in the age group of
12 to 39</a>
could register interest to sign up for vaccine appointments by filling in
their particulars in a <a href="https://preregister.vaccine.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple registration form.</a></p><p>As my parents had already gotten vaccinated, I filled up this form as soon
as I could. After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to
provide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at
one of the <a href="https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinics or vaccination centers</a> for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have
been given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to
receive this SMS.</p><p>Another thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for
booking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I
believe that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered
to the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer
vaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher efficacy</a> and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milder side-effects</a>.</p><p>However, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the
Moderna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as
compared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting
my shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore
Government is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to
get their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the
population vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up,
as evidenced by examples of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other developed nations reopening,
particularly in the West</a>.</p><p>I&#x27;m glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination.
Thankfully, I did not experience any of the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms mentioned in the
information sheet</a>, so I left immediately after the observation period was over. </p><p>Upon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also
received two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my
family has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they
were being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise
caution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from
the Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.</p><p>I would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug
allergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about
whether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug
allergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with
the ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice:
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moderna</a> or <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pfizer</a>. Rest assured, you will be asked the required
questions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well
as before you take the vaccine.</p><p>Before you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it&#x27;s easier to roll them up as you get your shot.</p><p>With this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, I&#x27;m feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/covid-19">covid-19</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/vaccines">vaccines</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">¬´ Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
