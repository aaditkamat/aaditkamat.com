It isn&#x27;t surprising, given that the nature of college life is hectic and variable. The workload for the semester changes depending on the number of credits you need to clear, what specialization you wish to pursue, and in general what your goals are for that semester.</p><p>However, as a college graduate who has now joined the workforce, it&#x27;s essential for me to adhere to a daily routine. This is because work starts and ends every day at about fairly the same time and there are other tasks I need to do as part of my routine, such as writing, for example. </p><p>Other than that, I also feel that the routine is what will give me the strength to persist with longer term goals, especially when the going gets tough. If the day shapes out to be haphazard, it will eventually impact the quality of my life.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I looked up Cal Newport&#x27;s daily routine recently. The reason I did so is that I&#x27;m impressed with all the work he has done outside his full-time job as a Computer Science professor, which in itself is a demanding job. </p><p>As a result, I came upon a website called mymorningroutine.com. This website provides transcripts of conversations that the team behind the My Morning Routine magazine had with about 343 professionals who have achieved success in their respective endeavours, from writing to entrepreneurship. </p><p>It would be fallacious to say that all of these individuals owe their success primarily to their morning routines, as that is inferring causation from correlation. However, reading through some of these interviews has reinforced my belief that a routine, as boring as it sounds, is indeed an ingredient for success.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How To Learn</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 19, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>This morning, I started reading a book called &quot;Learn Like A Pro&quot; by Barbara Oakley. I had taken her course &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot;, which was one of the most popular MOOCs on Coursera at the time. </p><p>Even though the course had a lot of useful tips for students, I did not end up applying those in my own college studies at NUS, which I suspect is one of the reasons I did not fare well.</p><p>One of the tips that Barbara shares in the book is breaking your study time into chunks using the Pomodoro technique. Even when it seems like a task takes variable amounts of time to complete, I&#x27;d highly suggest sticking to this technique. </p><p>This is because 25 minutes is the perfect amount of time to maintain focus on the task, and completing a Pomodoro gives your brain that dopamine boost it needs to stay motivated, especially if the task at hand is arduous. </p><p>Another important aspect of the Pomodoro technique is that it allows you to schedule breaks in between your work. Taking breaks is important for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it forages all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode where it can make connections between disparate strands of information to give you a higher-level picture, or a mental model, based on that information.</p><p>Even as I have graduated from college, I have come to realise that it&#x27;s important for me to improve my learning performance. Hence, I would recommend this book to learners of all ages so that you can better understand how the brain works and apply insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology to take charge of your own learning.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-social-media-doing-us-more-harm-than-good">Is social media doing us more harm than good?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 17, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Since the start of May, I&#x27;ve been cutting back on my social media time.

Social media applications have had a positive impact by creating online communities that contribute to the knowledge base on the internet. They can bring value to a lot of people, in their personal lives or careers.</p><p>However, I hope people can take a step back and reassess their relationship with this technology. In my own case, I feel that it is useful to post my atomic essays on Twitter for accountability but I&#x27;ve set up a feed-blocker extension on my browser so that I don&#x27;t get hooked on it again.

I don&#x27;t necessarily think that boredom is something that must be avoided at all costs, but it does make me uncomfortable. It lulls me into the false trap of thinking that I&#x27;m not being productive.</p><p>Over the course of time, I&#x27;ve come to realize that this notion is inaccurate and can even be detrimental. That is why when I first heard Cal Newport speak about how boredom can in fact be crucial when you are doing deep work, I felt that his words resonated with me. </p><p>To be fair, Newport says that he does not lionize boredom the way some others studying original thinkers do. However, he says that there is enough research literature that points towards doing the boring &quot;deep work&quot; and then taking a break from it to do something else, something mundane or ritualistic, as being key for generating great ideas. In such cases, the brain works in the background even as the human body is carrying out other tasks not remotely connected to the field of thought that the brain is pursuing.</p><p>When you are working on any long term project, you are bound to go through stretches of boredom followed by periods of insight. Trying to tackle the boredom by switching to another window to catch up on email, Slack notifications or the social media feed leaves the brain with insufficient time to think about the problems that we wish to solve. This has reshaped my belief that boredom can actually be a good thing and should be embraced for longer-term success.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/unsubscribe-from-all-email-newsletters">Unsubscribe from all (ok, maybe most) email newsletters</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 16, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>As of late, I have found myself unsubscribing from a lot of email newsletters. While some such as the Morning Brew are important for me to catch up with the news for the day, others just don&#x27;t provide me as much value as I had expected when I first signed up for them. I am particularly annoyed by the newsletters that I get from different companies informing me about their latest events or products and services starting to get a little annoying. Yes Apple, I&#x27;m talking about all those emails you have sent me for the 1-year Apple TV+ subscription or the 6 months free Apple Music subscription that I absolutely do not need at this point.</p><p>As I seek a minimalist digital lifestyle, it&#x27;s important for me to unsubscribe from all those newsletters that I find clogging up my inbox. While this task has become more difficult as I&#x27;ve unwittingly ended up inviting emails from a lot of different service providers over time, either by opting for the newsletters knowingly or doing so unknowingly while registering for an account, there are online tools like Unroll.me and clean.email that have come to my aid to clear up my inbox.</p><p>I believe that having a clean inbox is a significant productivity boost because it helps you declutter your mind and focus only on those emails that truly matter. Overflowing email has acquired the proportions of a first-world problem that many of us face in this digital age, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be a nightmare.

I remember discussing this issue with a relative who brought up the point about how the population has grown from less than a billion in the 1800s to a whopping figure of 7.9 billion, quadrupling over the last century. </p><p>He described it as the elephant in the room, the issue that was not being discussed with as much fervour as say climate change. A growing population meant more mouths to feed and this would eventually place constraints on governments who have to cater to the demands of the populace. </p><p>In particular, he mentioned how the progress that India had made in terms of GDP growth seemed to be evened out by the population growth. In view of these issues, the efforts made by governments to tackle population growth such as China&#x27;s former one-child policy and the two-child policy now being promoted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India seem more than welcome.</p><p>Watching a Kurzgesagt video on overpopulation however, changed my perspective on it. Instead of focussing on the doom and gloom that is generally associated with a burgeoning population, the video addressed the trends in demographic transition that have emerged in developing countries like Bangladesh, which mirror those that had been seen in the now-developed countries like Britain post-industrialisation. </p><p>Due to improvements in healthcare, growing life spans and more educated citizens, the birth rates have started to decline and the population growth has more or less stabilised. This paints a more positive picture of the road ahead, if other countries lagging behind begin to follow this trend, with help from the developed countries.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/a-minimalistic-approach-to-our-digital-lives">A minimalistic approach to our digital lives</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-13T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 13, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Let&#x27;s face it, all of us are surrounded by a lot of information right now, produced by a large number of creators that exist within the digital landscape.

Or is all that information confusing us instead?</p><p>In a recent conversation with a friend, I shared with her why I had decided to limit my social media usage. </p><p>One of the reasons why I did so is because I noticed that my relationship with social media had started to change in college and took a turn for the worst after the pandemic. Another reason that inspired to me to make this change was an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science professor at the Georgetown University who writes about the intersection of tech and culture. He advocates quitting social media altogether and emphasises the need for digital minimalism required for to do &quot;deep work&quot;, or long periods of focused work with minimal distractions.</p><p>I know that it&#x27;s impractical for a lot of people to quit social media altogether, especially those whose work relies heavily on it. I find Newport&#x27;s watered down stance more useful in this regard: Spend some time away from your devices to reassess your relationship with technology. Pick the tools that are in alignment with your goals. </p><p>The way I see it, this will establish a bottom up relationship with technology driven by personal needs rather than a top down relationship where you end up adding more apps that seem useful but just aren&#x27;t.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/are-we-living-in-a-simulation">Are we living in a simulation?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 12, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I first started to contemplate the idea of whether reality is a simulation as I reflected upon the complexity of human life and the history of mankind. </p><p>Two key events sparked this line of thought: reading Sapiens, a magnum opus written by the celebrated historian Yuval Noah Harari, as well as discussing about meditating on the nature of reality with a dear friend. It&#x27;s how we as a human society have reached where we are right now, achieving technological progress at an ever-accelerating pace, that has perplexed me.</p><p>I&#x27;m a theist but I&#x27;ve not really subscribed to one religious view completely, even as a practicing Hindu. I used to conceptualise God as a supernatural force that permeates the very fabric of the cosmos. </p><p>Now though, the idea that we may be living in a simulation opens up entertaining possibilities. Are we characters being controlled by players of an arcade game? Are we a hive mind that is being controlled by a computer? Or perhaps all of this has originated in a single mind that has been coerced to live in a dream?</p><p>Of course, none of the questions I have posed here are novel. In fact, they have been inspired from popular fiction such as the Matrix, Bladerunner, the Truman Show and Dark City that has delved into this topic.

Second, the exchange must mutually benefit them in a way that they perceive as being of equivalent value. </p><p>As one can see, such a system quickly becomes cumbersome and unsustainable over time. Hence, it was necessary for humans to come up with a replacement that would allow people to transact without having these two key requirements in place.</p><p>Today, money plays that role since the buyer does not need to provide anything of material value to the seller apart from monetary payment. In return the buyer is expected to participate in the economy through some way, typically through the employment, where he ends up providing a valuable good or service to others in the company in which he is employed or to consumers directly if he is self-employed. </p><p>There are exceptions to this rule, but the engine of modern economy treads forward when the balance is maintained, as the supply meets the demand.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/stop-comparing-yourself-with-others">Stop comparing yourself with others</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 10, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>As I have had issues with self-confidence and compared myself with others, I was naturally drawn towards this question: Is comparison always a negative tendency? </p><p>Well, as in other matters in life, there is no straightforward answer because comparison can have positive as well as negative consequences.</p><p>I was listening to an episode on the podcast No Stupid Questions recently, where the hosts Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner were addressing the same question. Angela said that it is important to evaluate the tendency to compare from an evolutionary psychology standpoint. </p><p>Humans tend to compare their lives with lives of those who seem to be doing better because they wish to improve their lives. This is known as upward social comparison. This can be positive if the person does not get discouraged by others&#x27; accomplishments, but tends to have detrimental effects on the person&#x27;s mental health if done too often.</p><p>On the other hand, a person may also experience schadenfreude, taking joy at someone&#x27;s suffering. This is an example of downward social comparison. It rarely brings any benefit, since it does not improve the person&#x27;s own wellbeing and may make the person feel guilty for experiencing such emotions instead.</p><p>I would conclude by saying that everyone needs to introspect and control this tendency if it is harming them. This is easier said than done, but you can only grow as a person if you seek to improve by competing with yourself, not with others.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries Â»</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
