Yesterday morning, I had gone to the East Coast Park with my friend Yash. We met at the bus stop near the block 289H at 8:15. The weather looked good for our planned cycling trip, and we hoped that rain would not spoil the occasion.

We first planned to take a 506 bus towards the Trellis Towers in Toa Payoh, before transiting to the 966 bus towards the D'Ecosia comdominimums and walking for about 10 minutes.  We reached the Go Rental shop - near one of the entrances at East Coast Park - a little later than anticipated due to a delay boarding the 966, but we still had sufficient time to cycle around East Coast Park.

From the moment I entered, I could not help but appreciate the lush green spaces and the paths that wound around the park. It is an ideal picnic spot, so I could see many families enjoying themselves in the park. There were people playing volleyball along the beach, enthusiasts racing their remote controlled trucks along the tracks, children playing on the play grounds and even some volunteers busy cleaning the beach. I was overjoyed to take in all these sights and sounds, because such scenery can be found only in a few parks in Singapore even as there are spots in Sentosa or Marina Bay that draw crowds.

Unlike last time, we decided that we would cycle towards the Gardens By The Bay East, instead of further east towards the Bedok Jetty. We rented the mountain bikes at a $10/hour rate for two hours and got started our journey at about 10.

As it turned out, the Gardens were not too far: just 2.3km from the point where the exit led to a trail in the direction. Even then, we had to consult Google Maps once to make sure that we were heading in the right direction. Before coming to ECP yesterday, we were not aware that there was a straight route all the way to that part of the city.

Once we reached the Gardens, we cycled near the Floating Parade, by the venue for the F1 Night Grand Prix taking place in September, and twards Marina Barrage. That is where we stopped to snap some pictures of the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands. 

After that, we turned back and headed towards ECP at full speed, without taking any breaks in between. Since we had reached the rental shop before the 2 hours were up and we did not feel like exploring ECP more, we returned our bikes early. 

Hungry and tired, we headed towards Parkway Parade to have lunch. We were hard pressed to choose where we would have lunch and ultimately settled on Food Republic where we could find a variety of food available at decent prices.

Instead of taking the bus back home as initially planned, we chose to book a Grab ride home. We didn't doze off in the car, but we did catch a few winks. 

I really enjoyed that trip to ECP and I hope that I can go there a few more times this year. ECP and Changi Beach are two such venues on the East side where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the Singapore city and enjoy big, open spaces ideal for different kinds of outdoor activities.
