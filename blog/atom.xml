        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my response to a question that was asked on Quora recently: <a href="https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-is-the-problem-with-external-motivation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the problem with external motivation?</a></p><p>I don’t think that external motivation in itself is a bad thing. We all need that kind of motivation from time to time, whether it comes from other people in your life like friends, family and colleagues or from things that give value to what you do like money.</p><p>The problem lies in being too dependent on external motivation. Now, that’s a hard balance to achieve because you don’t know where you are crossing the line. If the source of external motivation runs dry, you find yourself wallowing, like a fish out of water.</p><p>There is a certain kind of satisfaction we get from being able to set our own goals and achieving them. External motivation can feel like a proxy, where the source of that motivation steps in to give you the satisfaction instead of you striving for it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, I read a short story written by Stephen King called “Elevation”.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Scott Carey is a 6-foot-four tall overweight American male living in a small town called Castle Rock in New England. He approaches Dr Bob Ellis to tell him about his unique situation: he has been experiencing weight loss, even as his mass has remained unchanged. Furthermore, he weighs the same undressed as he does with several layers of clothing on. Dr Bob, at first, does not believe Scott’s predicament, but is forced to accept it when Scott demonstrates using the doctor’s own precise weighing scales.</p><p>Scott has a strained relationship with his neighbours Dierdre McComb and Missy Donaldson, a married lesbian couple that has recently moved into Castle Rock. Scott is annoyed that Dierdre continues to let her dogs do their business in his lawn. Whenever Scott tries to share his problem with Dierdre, she dismisses him with a smile that indicates that she is least interested to listen to him. Scott hopes that they will be on good terms and that Dierdre behaves more like a good neighbour.</p><p>Scott soon finds out why the couple is unhappy in Castle Rock. Deirdre and Missy’s restaurant in Castle Town, Holy Frijole, has not been doing that well as of late. A major reason behind this is that the town’s inhabitants disapprove of Diedre and Missy because they openly declared themselves as a married lesbian couple. Castle Rock is in a county politically inclined towards Republican ideology and the residents see this open declaration as a form of political statement. </p><p>Scott tries to stand up for the ladies as one of the employees in the Castle Rock Public Works department makes unsavoury comments about them. However, this makes things only worse, because Deirdre feels that they had been cast again into the spotlight, just as their sexual orientation was fading away from the minds of Castle Rock’s residents</p><p>In a last attempt to make amends, Scott decides to participate in the town’s annual 12K Thanksgiving run, an event that Dierdre is also participating in, and place a wager on the winner of the competition. Diedre is a skilled marathon runner and is confident of her chances of winning. She hopes that winning will be a shot at redeeming lost glory, a chance to show to the others in Castle Rock that she is more than just her sexual orientation. Even though Scott looks clearly out of shape, he feels optimistic about his chances due to his weight loss.</p><p>Scott easily clears the first 8K of the marathon, but starts struggling for the next 2K, until the “wind changes'' and he regains his momentum. Towards the end, in the midst of heavy rain and thunder that erupts as the weather changes, he overtakes Dierdre and even helps her up to her feet when she stumbles, so that she can go on to win the race. The incident is reported in the local newspaper and Scott’s act of kindness is lauded by the Castle Rock residents. Holy Frijole’s business starts to boom, and Dierdre warms up to Scott.</p><p>After the race, Scott meets Dierdre and Missy for lunch, along with Doctor Bob and his wife Myra, as per the terms of the wager that Scott won. Scott then confides with them about the weird phenomenon he has been experiencing. The rate at which Scott had been losing weight had accelerated and he was expecting to be weightless by January next year. </p><p>This revelation brings all of them even closer. They try to make the most of Scott’s last few days, meeting up for lunch often at Holy Frijole. Scott wants Deidre to be the one that sets him free at the point where he loses all his weight, because he knows that she understands the feeling of being “elevated” - a state she herself reaches when she runs for a marathon, where she can forget all the blemishes of her character and become the best version of herself. </p><p>Even though Scott is going to die, he does so with the knowledge that he will not die buried in the ground, but rather soaring up in the skies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thoughts">Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I have heard about Stephen King a lot from my friend. Of course, I have also enjoyed the films Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, which are based on his novels. He is a very talented storyteller, who is able to draw you into the story right from the beginning. </p><p>The premise of this novel is novel: who would have thought a person would die of weightlessness on Earth, as the gravitational pull on him decreases rapidly? It is yet again Stephen King foray into the supernatural. He hints at a reality that is outside human understanding. As Scott says, weight is just a construct that helps man understand his physical reality better like time. </p><p>The book is not nearly as dark or foreboding as some of the other Stephen King ones, because Scott is generally happy even though he is acutely aware of his terminal illness. He is also able to make amends with the McCombes and enlist the help of Dierdre for his final journey. </p><p>Though I have never been to a small town in America - the closest is probably the college town of Chapel Hill which I visited during my exchange - I felt a sense of warmth reading about the close relationships that the town’s inhabitants share, even if it accompanies the gossip and the prejudices often associated with a closed mentality. It reminded me of the TV Shows I have watched or books I have read about the villages in India or small towns in England.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prompt: Share a threshold you crossed - what you expected it to be like, how that differed from reality, and what it took to make it through]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<b>Prompt: Share a threshold you crossed - what you expected it to be like, how that differed from reality, and what it took to make it through</b><p>I can distinctly recall the time I was waiting for the final examination results for my CBSE Class 12 All India Secondary School Certificate Examinations (AISSCE), back in June 2015. I could barely sleep the night before, as I wondered what results my efforts had accomplished. In my mind, the results were the entry ticket to a prestigious college – either here in Singapore or in the US. All while I was trying to get over the culture shock of being a recruit at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI) and completing the Basic Rescue Training as part of my National Service obligations.</p><p>To all the high school students awaiting for their results pensively, I wish to convey this: examinations are a part and parcel of student life. Use them as tools to gauge your grasp of concepts, not as tools to judge your self-worth.</p><p>I know that this is easier said than done, but believe me, just acknowledging this to yourself from time to time helps make the process easier. My hope is that this journal entry will be useful to you in getting over that anxiety. To all the other readers out there, if you are looking for some inspiration to overcome your hurdles, you are welcome to read this piece as well.</p><p>So how did I get into this situation? Let me give you all some context to understand my predicament. I was of an academic bent back in my high school years. Instead of participating in any kind of sports or recreational activities, I spent most of my time taking down notes, revising my study material and poring through the textbooks for insights.</p><p>As I performed well in my examinations and stayed on top of my homework, I was in the good books of my teachers. However, missing out on other aspects of the educational experience meant that it was not holistic enough. I was not taking good care of my health, my social life was virtually non-existent and I had no practical knowledge to supplement my theoretical knowledge from academic material.</p><p>I realized how woefully inadept I was at “roughing it out” when I enlisted into NSTI as a recruit. Not only was I burst out of the social bubble of Indians that I was interacting with during my time at the Global Indian International School, I was also no longer the stellar student. Instead, I was fledgling, as a nondescript recruit trying to complete my basic tasks and responsibilities. I was not particularly good at collaborating with fellow recruits who stayed in the same bunk and I kept getting reprimanded by my instructors when I failed to follow simple instructions.</p><p>Then came the month before the finals. While I had spent more than a year preparing for these, it was this final month where I had to step it up, to make my efforts count. Unlike the previous years, where the final scores were a cumulative of the scores obtained in different examinations with assigned weightages, the pressure I felt was different this time, because only the scores from these finals would be factored in during the admission process.</p><p>As far as I can remember, I spent most of my waking hours studying. I felt guilty whenever I felt that I was taking unnecessary breaks. My exercise time dwindled even further and there were times when I felt burnt out. To top it all, I did not perform as well in my practice tests and that only increased my anxiety about my performance.</p><p>It took an unanticipated outburst at my parents for me to realize that I had to slow down a little, take it easy. I told myself that I was not going to succeed by thinking too much about the final destination, but by focussing on the process . This meant setting incremental goals – getting a better score with each subsequent practice test, for example – and pushing the limits, slowly but surely.</p><p>Most importantly, I had let go of my own exalted aspirations and my parent’s expectations, so that I could focus on those incremental goals. Thankfully, my parents were quite supportive. They encouraged me to give my best, but also “hit the reset button” when things felt too overwhelming. This gave me the strength to plough through.</p><p>Well, I passed the examinations with flying colours. I stood 3rd in the school and surpassed my expectations. Most importantly, I felt a sense of relief surge through me as I got to know about my results. The circumstances around the announcement of my results were rather unexpected: one of the instructors took me aside after the class to tell me that I should call my mom, as she was the one who had informed him that she wished to share some important news with me. Generally, we were not allowed to use mobile phones over the course of the training during the day, but my instructor was kind enough to make an exception on this occasion.</p><p>Thanks to my excellent results, I was admitted into the National University of Singapore (NUS) to pursue a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. This was a dream come true!</p><p>However, once I had matriculated, I realized that the ballgame was different. Focussing on academics was one thing, but it was equally important to think about a career post-graduation and gain work experience through internships.</p><p>Landing an internship came with its own set of challenges, especially if as a freshman or sophomore with little prior experience. I had to build a portfolio, and I realized that it would be better to work on projects outside those that are part of curriculum.</p><p>Apart from school work and internships, I found more opportunities to network as I was part of a wider circle. True, a lot of my friends in NUS were Indians as well, but I met many more from different backgrounds, having a diverse set of experiences, just like I had during my time at NSTI.</p><p>This was also the time that I was exposed to communities, online and offline. I had to learn to manage my time better so that I could attend to all these competing interests, without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>Even on an academic front, studying the way I used to in high school wasn’t going to cut it. I had to adapt to the continual modes of assessment, that varied based on the course. Consistency and effective study strategies were more important than the actual time spent studying.</p><p>College made me realize how my perspective about life was circumscribed and how I could look towards the horizon for pushing my limits. I hope to hold on to this attitude of curiosity and open-mindedness as I have embarked on a new journey through my career post-graduation.</p><p>This Steve Jobs quote inspires me a lot: “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you, and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early this morning, I attended a talk given by Nadia Zhuk, a software engineer at <a href="http://intercom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercom</a> and mentor at <a href="https://meetamentor.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet a Mentor</a>, on the <a href="https://www.codementor.io/events/how-working-as-a-programmer-helped-me-write-a-book-e1gbc1hk2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codementor Events</a> platform. This talk was geared not just toward other software developers but also toward those looking to break into tech. In this talk, Nadia shared her experience with translating lessons learned from coding into her writing with her audience. </p><p>Before working at companies like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk</a> and Intercom as a software engineer, Nadia was a news reporter and a copywriter. This work led her to different places, from Belarus to Israel to Ireland and London, where she now lives. </p><h1>Takeaways</h1><p>These are my takeaways from the talk:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure">Lesson #1: Learn to embrace failure<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had a tough time preparing for her coding interviews at Zendesk. She had barely picked up HTML after struggling with it and even giving up a couple of times. She felt that her skills were up to the mark, even though she had some development experience before applying to Zendesk. Even after cracking the interviews, she felt that collaborating with senior developers in the team who were much more skilled would be pretty daunting. </p><p>However, Nadia slowly learned to bite the bullet and embrace failure. Since her work at companies like Zendesk and Intercom needed to be of a high standard, Nadia realized that she had to take all the feedback on her work in her stride. </p><p>This is one of the first lessons she applied to her writing: she had to be comfortable with the negative criticisms she received for the first draft of her book. She found it difficult to do so because her editor told her that the draft felt incoherent and structured more like a series of long blog posts rather than a novel. It lacked a proper narrative flow. </p><p>Nadia shared that while she was gracious enough in accepting failure initially, she learned a lot from her editor's feedback for the first draft that she could apply to her other drafts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-2-learn-from-the-best">Lesson #2: Learn from the best<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-2-learn-from-the-best" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another major lesson that she applied from her coding experience was to learn from the best. When she first started developing in Ruby, she referred to books written by some of the most widely known and respected engineers in the Ruby community. Even though their writings sometimes went over her head, she did not give up and instead used her inability to grasp concepts as opportunities to slowly but surely improve her craft. </p><p>Before drafting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56082981-crossing-the-rubycon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her book</a>, Nadia had read books written by great authors such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen King</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Zinsser</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2417381.The_Collected_Oscar_Wilde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Wilde</a>, amongst others, who dispensed some valuable lessons on writing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out">Lesson #3: Get yourself unstuck by talking it out<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Programming can be a rather tedious affair. You have to often spend a significant amount of time discovering bugs in your code, sometimes even more than writing all that code in the first place. When developers get frustrated working on their programs, they often resort to a technique colloquially known as <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"talking to the rubber duck."</a> This means that developers review their code in greater detail and talk through it during the review. Some developers use a rubber duck as a persona to communicate their thoughts verbally, but catching hold of another developer works just fine. </p><p>Writing, similarly, is nefariously hard and can feel even more lonely as the lone writer does most of the heavy lifting, at least during the drafting process. Talking through the writing helps the writer combat the loneliness that accompanies the writing process and get the ball rolling when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writer's block</a> impedes progress.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro">Lesson #4: Learn to "be a pro"<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another invaluable lesson Nadia learned is to "be a pro." This sounds rather generic, but Nadia meant to say that she learned to respect her side projects, in this case, the writing project, as she would her day-to-day work. </p><p>Initially, she would leave most of her writing work for the weekends and could not find the discipline to stick to a schedule. She realized soon enough, however, that she would not be able to finish her writing on time this way. Hence, she started to write on other days of the week and even during vacations. </p><p>Each day she wrote, she stuck to the task of writing until she was sure that she had nothing more to write that day. Being consistent and showing up counts more than talent most of the time, and this, Nadia feels, can be used to accomplish many goals that initially seem quite daunting. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-5-get-feedback-early">Lesson #5: Get feedback early<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-5-get-feedback-early" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had shown her first draft to the editor only after two months of grokking through it. In retrospect, she regrets delaying the process of getting feedback from her editor as she had to rewrite significant chunks during her second draft. That is why she feels that it is essential to get feedback as early as possible and get the book's overall structure outlined and approved before diving into the actual writing. </p><p>In a way, it's helpful to approach writing with an <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agile</a> mindset, shipping out the work fast and iterating several times based on the feedback, just like you would when you ship software by following agile processes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The primary lesson Nadia wished to impart through this talk was that she could successfully transition into her developer role because she reviewed the skills from her previous roles and tried to find some overlap with the skills required for her new roles. When she could not find that overlap, she approached the process of skill building like a craftsman: picking up things from scratch, refining her skills with inputs from the best, and learning to embrace the failures. </p><h1>Q &amp; A</h1><p>During the Q &amp; A section, the first question I asked Nadia was about her writing tools. She replied that she had not invested in any fancy writing software. Instead, she chose to stick to <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a>, where she could get comments from her editor. In addition to Google Docs, she used <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProWritingAid</a> for writing suggestions beyond the simple grammatical and spelling checks carried out on Google Docs.</p><p>I also asked her about her blogging experience. While she said that she did not blog much before becoming an author and only does so occasionally even now, she wrote a lot when she studied journalism and learned a good bit about writing as a copy editor. Even though she learned about writing in Russian, she was able to use her understanding of the mechanics of writing in one language to guide her writing in another language, English.</p>]]></content>

This happens often when I explore the dark side of humanity, especially as it is depicted in some forms of media. </p><p>In the media, human drama appears to emphasize both the positive and negative sides of human behaviour, often not in conjunction but rather separately. Therefore, we end up focusing on only one side, rather than seeing both sides equally, as we would if we observed human behaviour daily. </p><p>We also tend to focus more on the negative side of things because of our <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/negativity-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">negativity bias</a>, where as many as <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five positive experiences may be required to overcome the effects of one negative experience</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.prismic.io/thedecisionlab/da54d547-18f1-4442-b977-59ab514d3d5c_Negativity+bias.jpg?auto=compress,format" width="700px" alt="Negativity bias comic" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Negativity Bias </figcaption></figure><p>At some point though, even these positive and negative labels do not suffice to describe human experiences.

Second, there is a major chunk of human experiences that simply cannot be categorised this way.</p><p>Take for instance a person travelling on a bus or a train. If the person is enjoying themselves having a conversation with another, they can label that experience as positive. On the other hand, if they get into an altercation with the person during that conversation, they can label that experience as negative. But what about all the time spent in between where the person is not engaged in one thing or the other? Both the labels do not suffice to categorize such an experience. </p><p>On an individual level, therefore, taking stock of your <a href="https://lifedesignlog.com/rose-thorn-bud-activity-for-group-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roses, thorns and buds</a> helps you analyse your experiences on a spectrum.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lifedesignlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rose-thorn-bud-activity-descriptions.png" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Rose, Thorn &amp; Bud </figcaption></figure><p>Contrasted with the destructive feeling of misanthropy is the feeling of unconditional love that I find myself gravitating towards more strongly.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari decodes one of the major reasons that humans have been able to "rule the world" - the ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, forming communities that believe in shared intersubjective realities. </p><p>To the best of our knowledge, other animals live in dual realities, objective and subjective. Objective realities are those that exist independent of our individual sensations and experiences (e.g. physical forces that have existed since the creation of the universe) while subjective realities arise from individual sensations and experiences (e.g. emotions like pain, anger, and love that feel real but cannot be detected by others). They do not believe in abstract concepts like God, Money, and the Economy. </p><p>Our might as a species does not stem from individual intelligence or extraordinary toolmaking capabilities. If so we could have conquered the world much earlier, as an average Homo Sapiens in a hunter-gatherer band was more skilled than an average Homo Sapiens in the modern era.
Instead, it is due to increasingly sophisticated mechanisms of large-scale collaborations, made by possible a web of intersubjective realities, that have transformed us from those who sharpen flintstones to those who can now travel in space and dream of conquering other civilizations.</p><p>Many philosophical texts have alluded to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis#Origins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reality as an illusion</a>. A popular proposal that explores this concept further is the <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Simulation Hypothesis"</a> postulated by Nick Bostrom, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. More interesting though is the concept of illusory reality, i.e. reality is not as it appears. Even the objective realities we experience as a collective may be an illusion, but our intersubjective realities are certainly illusory. </p><p>These, as per Buddhist beliefs, are a primary cause of our suffering. Our expectations are shaped by these intersubjective realities and never truly match the objective or subjective realities. We continue to seek more but we are rarely ever content. Even when we are content, we assume that these intersubjective realities are permanent, granted to us by a foreign agency such as God or laws that are sacred and immortal as if they were ordained by nature and not by other humans who are subject to vagaries just like the rest of us. </p><p>This realization is like a <a href="https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-17-the-red-pill-of-renunciation-embracing-reality-as-it-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Pill that liberates you from the cycle of unnecessary suffering</a>. The key difference from the Red Pill in the Matrix though is that you don't just take the Red Pill once, rather you have to take it multiple times throughout your life: each time you choose to either let your happiness be governed entirely by intersubjective realities or to take charge for your own happiness by seeing reality for it is.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We can never achieve things as individuals. Individuals in themselves are too erratic - they experience much change over their lifetimes, they have underlying motivations that are too complex, their minds waver too much.</p><p>I feel that the analogies from physics provide good abstractions to understand chaos at an individual level. Think of particles in a gaseous substance. They are separate from each other because the binding forces are weak. When bound in a container, they bounce around and collide with each other at times. It's almost impossible to predict the velocity and position of each individual particle. However, when you think of the substance as a whole, it has some predictable properties that have been well-studied.</p><p>Let's shift gears a little, still remaining within the physical realm. Now think about atoms in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radioactive material</a>. It is again almost impossible to predict when the individual atom will decay because the process is probabilistic. However, the rate of radioactive decay of the material as a whole is well-defined.</p><p>As suggested by Warren Weaver in his influential article <a href="https://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Science and Complexity"</a>, science itself went through a paradigm shift as we studied data from many different individual phenomena and applied the law of large numbers to analyze this data to solve problems of disorganized complexity. This data is often distributed in some manner which gives us patterns to extrapolate and predict. An individual event is too random, but the predictions we can make based on the patterns we observe are more certain.</p><p>Even from a sociological perspective, there are phenomena that help us understand this group effect better. An example that comes to mind is the "collective wisdom" phenomenon demonstrated by a study that journalist James Suroweicki describes in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1636023205&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Wisdom of the Crowds",</a> where a large number of people were able to predict the number of marbles in a jar when individual guesses tended to be way off.</p><p>An irony is that even as a lot of us may be aware of these group effects through our studies of the sciences, we see ourselves as just a little bit special than others. That is why we may see our lives are different and view them with a preferential bias that gets shattered when outlier events, termed as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black swan events by statistician Nassim Taleb</a> occur in our lives. As Daniel Kahneman points out in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Thinking Fast and Slow",</a> even scientific researchers, whom you would generally hold to a higher standard, suffer from such systematic biases.</p><p>The reality, however, is that we are interdependent, interconnected. Despite our uniqueness, in the larger scheme of things, we are no more than a statistic. Each of our lives is thus of equal importance: no more, no less. This is best captured in the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependent origination</a> that is central to all Schools of Buddhism - nothing exists in itself, but exists only in conjunction with others.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just as industrialization had created physical consumer markets through surplus production of goods, digitalization has created digital consumer markets through surplus production of content. </p><p>It's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of consumption once you get exposed to different kinds of information on the different media platforms. The main difference is that digital media platforms have access to more data and sophisticated algorithms to better analyze insights from the data so that they can essentially "hack into your psychology". </p><p>This has become an even bigger problem <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-digital-addiction-made-worse-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to the pandemic</a> where people are cut off from each other due to social distancing and forced to spend more time at home, left to their digital devices. </p><p>I have experienced this personally. I used to be wary of using social media longer than intended before I enrolled in college. However, in a bid to form connections as a college student, I ended up mindlessly following a lot of people on different social media platforms. In particular, as I started spending more time at home after the pandemic, I found myself becoming addicted to Twitter. </p><p>Twitter seemed great as I had access to thoughts from different great minds on the planets via their Tweets. I also did not have to read news articles or watch the news channels - I could read the summaries on my Twitter feed instead. </p><p>I only began to grasp the gravity of the problem after I lashed out at my parents in anger, for no fault of theirs. As I reflected upon the cause of my anger, I realized it was due to pent-up frustration - the frustration triggered by all the social justice-related Tweets I had read. </p><p>I hadn't been doing great in school up till that point, but I ended up sinking more time into social media than I should have and this most certainly contributed to my grades tanking.  </p><p>I can be impulsive, so once I read <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post written by Cal Newport that resonated with me</a>, I decided to deactivate most of my social media handles. This did help curb the addiction, but I soon realized that it wasn't a good long-term solution. I found a <a href="https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-make-social-media-work-for-you-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better way to use social media</a>: to share the essays I was writing through the #Ship30for30 challenge or on my blog. </p><p>Going on "social media lite" made me understand an important principle that seems to apply in other areas as well: limit consumption and increase production. You have to consume as you need to learn from others. However, when you switch to the productivity mode, you switch to a mindset of what value do you provide - giving more than you take. </p><p>That's why there is so much emphasis on productivity in the modern world. No matter what kind of work you do, you are providing some kind of value. You get paid precisely because you provide value. Your value increases when you focus on what you can give rather than what you receive in the form of benefits. </p><p>Even if we leave aside the career aspect of productivity aside, I believe that channeling productivity, such as through <a href="https://aaditkamat.github.io/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creativity, increases happiness</a> in the long run as it gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This comes in handy especially when you need to soldier through the challenges in life.</p><p>That is why the minimalist philosophy is so appealing. As you adopt this philosophy, you start to realize that you don't need too much to be happy. This allows you to step down from the hedonistic treadmill, which leaves you craving for more and more. </p><p>Whilst the pandemic has been a major upheaval that left much destruction in its wake, it has also been a stark reminder of what truly matters: human connection and mental/physical wellbeing over materialistic wealth. Producing good work and sharing it with other people in the community who may benefit from it sparks true joy. Even when things don't turn out the way you expected, which happens more often than not, you feel contented as you have given your best, which is all you could have done under the circumstances.</p><p>We cannot unplug ourselves from the internet, but the best way we can make sense of all the information we are exposed to without becoming overwhelmed is to use it to create something of our own and share it with others.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you to Manus Wong whose post on <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how consumerism is killing our creativity</a> echoed my sentiments on the topic and in turn inspired this post.</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just before writing this, I was leafing through some chapters]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just before writing this, I was leafing through some chapters
of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chanakya-Daily-Life-Radhakrishnan-Pillai/dp/8129144441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Chanakya in Daily Life" by Radhakrishnan Pillai</a>.
This is one of the books that I instinctively know that I would keep coming back to over the years. It has distilled the 6,000 sutras from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chanakya's Arthashastra</a> that cover a wide range of topics (over 1, 000 by
the author's estimation) into 3 components of life that are important
to everyone: personal, professional, and familial.</p><p>These are some of my takeaways from this book.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="writing-a-book">Writing a book<a class="hash-link" href="#writing-a-book" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A book is a major undertaking. It takes a minimum of 6 months to a year
of consistent writing once a rough outline is planned and a publisher
has accepted the proposal. Adding on top of that the other demands to ensure good book sales such as marketing it through various channels,
going through several rounds of editing and discussion with the publisher
and reaching out to beta readers for feedback, makes the journey seem even more daunting.</p><p>However, it's a journey worth undertaking because you are leaving something for posterity.
The author cites the example of the Arthashastra. If Chanakya had not
written it, the future generations would have been left bereft of its wisdom.</p><p>If the idea of a book sounds impractical, it may help to maintain a diary
or a blog instead. The best time to write is at night as you can reflect
upon the happenings of the day. A month of journaling provides a lot of material
in itself. Over the span of a year, you may have enough writing to fit into a book.</p><p>An instance that springs to mind is the Diary of Anne Frank. The diary
was a coping mechanism for a young girl who was trying to survive the atrocities
that the Holocaust heaped upon her family and friend, as Jews in Nazi Germany.
It not only bore testament to her indomitable spirit in the face of adversity,
but also provided interesting insights into the psyche of a teenager.</p><p>Her struggles would be relatable to a lot of people today, who have had to bear the
the brunt of a surge of relentless lockdowns due to the current pandemic.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="listening-to-music">Listening to music<a class="hash-link" href="#listening-to-music" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Music has the power to uplift your mood. In the past, kings would wake up to
the sound of royal music. Chanakya himself took great pains to
arrange the right kind of music, based on the king's moods. To do so,
he sought counsel from some of the best music composers in the kingdom.</p><p>Nowadays, there are a plethora of playlists available thanks to streaming platforms
like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/browse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>, and
<a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Music</a>. The key here is to be
mindful in curating a playlist for the day, keeping in mind the fluctuations
of mood over the course of the day.</p><p>For example, if you need to focus most intently during the morning, you should select soft music. Increase the intensity of the music
as the pace of work picks up.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developing-a-creative-hobby">Developing a creative hobby<a class="hash-link" href="#developing-a-creative-hobby" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Apart from work, it is important to cultivate at least one or two hobbies
that keep you engaged. Without these, life can start to feel humdrum.</p><p>The best hobbies are the ones that involve some amount of creativity.
Writing, singing, dancing, cooking, and painting: all of these are creative
activities because they allow you to freely express yourself.</p><p>It may even be worthwhile to do <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/5-Minute-Creative-Workouts-Get-Your-Creativity-in-Shape/483111042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative workouts</a> once in a while to
shake things up. These allow you to put your "creative muscles" to work.
Nothing is sadder than the demise of a creative hobby.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="taking-a-power-nap">Taking a power nap<a class="hash-link" href="#taking-a-power-nap" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>While this may sound counterintuitive, sometimes taking a nap can be
a major productivity boost. The best time of the day for such "power naps"
is the afternoon. It may be difficult to work those into your schedule, especially
if you are overloaded with work, but try to make time for such naps
on occasion.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="finding-a-mentor">Finding a mentor<a class="hash-link" href="#finding-a-mentor" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In this digital age, we have all the information from around the
globe at our fingertips as they say. One can also find tons of "gurus"
on social media platforms that seem to dispense good advice for free.</p><p>The main barrier though is what information you can trust. Another
concern is that even information from trusted sources can be harmful, if
it is misinterpreted.</p><p>Hence, it is important to find mentors or guides in the areas of life
that you wish to succeed. Before you seek them out though, you need
to ascertain first whether these areas are indeed truly important to you.</p><p>The author mentions his example to illustrate this point. Due to the lack of formal training material on Chanakya's Arthashastra, he had to reach out to a Sanskrit scholar from the <a href="https://www.chinmayamission.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinmaya mission</a> who could educate him on the meaning of the different sutras.
This has allowed the author to craft this book, as well as several others, based on the
teachings from the Arthashastra.</p><p>--</p><p>The book covers over 70 topics, so there's a wealth of information
for anyone and everyone. There are simple yet powerful principles
to design a fulfilling life. I hope that my takeaways inspire more people
to pick up this book right away.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had watched "The Matrix" a couple of years ago. I enjoyed watching it, but I could not appreciate the inherently philosophical nature of the movie. A close friend of mine who had watched it recently suggested that I rewatch it as he believed that I would be able to glean new insights from the film. And indeed, I could not help but marvel at its beauty. It feels as though each line from the film has some nugget of wisdom hidden in it. That's why I thought that I would write up a blog post sharing some of my takeaways from the film.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-choice">About choice<a class="hash-link" href="#about-choice" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At a surface level, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeovers_in_popular_culture#1950s_and_earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dystopian science fiction film that discusses the existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence</a>. However, at a deeper level, the movie talks about choice: the role humans can play in shaping their destinies.</p><p>One of the scenes that immediately pops up to the mind is the choice between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill that Neo has to make if he wants to truly understand the nature of the Matrix. However, there are several other small or big choices that Neo has to make: choosing to follow Trinity's instructions or searching for Morpheus on his own, choosing to believe that he is the "Chosen One" or not, choosing to risk his life to save Morpheus's life. </p><p>The freedom of choice is juxtaposed with the role of destiny. As Neo says to Morpheus, he does not believe in fate because that means that he does not have control over his life. This seems to apply pretty well to the world of the Matrix because it is meant to be deterministic but may not apply to the "real world". However, it highlights the human tendency to be proactive, as opposed to reactive, and try to expand their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/980363-proactive-people-focus-their-efforts-in-the-circle-of-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circle of influence</a>.</p><p>One of the characters, who goes by the alias "Mouse", has programmed a woman in a red dress to be sent out into the Matrix. She serves as a distraction, literally a red herring (hence the color red). The way I interpreted it, it seemed like a message that humans who choose to lead a focused life have to cull a lot of distractions along the way to reach their goal(s). This is especially true in this digital age where such distractions abound.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-buddhism">About Buddhism<a class="hash-link" href="#about-buddhism" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Central to religions like Buddhism is the practice of meditation. There are several kinds of meditation exercises, but one of the most basic ones involves focussing intently on your breath. That's because it is a sure way of grounding you in the present moment. When Neo resists as he learns the truth about the Matrix and goes into a spiral, Morpheus asks him to breathe to stay calm. This is almost certainly a reference to the role of breath in staying grounded. It's also not a coincidence that Morpheus seems to spout a lot of Buddhist koan-like statements such as this one:</p><blockquote><p>Neo: I thought it wasn't real
Morpheus: Your mind makes it real
Neo: If you're killed in the matrix, you die here?
Morpheus: The body cannot live without the mind </p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-discovery">About discovery<a class="hash-link" href="#about-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When Trinity first meets Neo she says:</p><blockquote><p>It's the question that drives us, Neo...The answer is out there looking for you and it will find you if you want it to</p></blockquote><p>This drives home the point about life being a process of search and discovery. Few of the truths we seek are objective, except perhaps those that we have stipulated and agreed upon as laws.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-belief">About belief<a class="hash-link" href="#about-belief" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Neo spends a lot of the time believing that he is not the "chosen One". However, when he's forced to choose between his life and Morpheus's life, he becomes much more decisive. He takes the reins of freeing Morpheus into his own hands. Even though he's faced by agents who are much stronger and faster than he is, Neo is able to free his mind from fear and other delusions to unlock his true potential. In doing so, he sees the Matrix as it truly is: computer code processing data in a mainframe. He is, therefore, able to thwart the attempts made by the Matrix to control him.</p><p>The sparring session between Morpheus and neo underscores the importance of belief even further:</p><blockquote><p>Morpheus: How did I beat you?
Neo: You... you're too fast.
Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that's air you're breathing now?</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-reality">About reality<a class="hash-link" href="#about-reality" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As Morpheus is explaining the nature of the Matrix, he questions Neo:</p><blockquote><p>What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p></blockquote><p>This alludes to that our mind is a VR simulator in itself: we form perceptions about the world in front of us, based on what are actually electrical sensory inputs.</p><p>Thinking about the "real world" in this light, it doesn't seem absurd that Cerebro should wish to betray the other crew members and return to the Matrix. Is the outside world any less real than the world of the Matrix? It becomes a matter of perspective because you can hack your psychology to "Blue Pill" it away.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-love">About Love<a class="hash-link" href="#about-love" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>During Neo's first meeting with the Oracle, she points to a banner and says:</p><blockquote><p>Do you know what means? It's Latin. It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.</p></blockquote><p>True love, just like success and happiness, is an aspiration that is hard to achieve. The more you go out of the way to find "true love", the more it seems to elude you. The best you can do is share your feelings with someone whom you truly find special. If you are lucky, you may find love on your first try. Often though, it takes trial and tribulations, rejections after rejections, before you find love. </p><p>In the end, you have to go with your gut because you can't decode the inner workings of your mind.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kids usually have no idea about what they wish to pursue as a career growing up. That's ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.</p><p>There are exceptions: the so called "prodigies". <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson's study</a> provides good grounds to study expert performance:</p><blockquote><p>The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.</p></blockquote><p>Hence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.</p><p>There are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:
1) "Nurture": Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain</p><p>2) "Nature": The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it's a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast</p><p>That's why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery. If you force them to pick something else to specialize in, they are likely to have some regret: "what if, instead, I had pursued something I was truly interested in"? </p><p>Trevor Noah has expressed this sentiment beautifully in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1633442048&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Born A Crime"</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days</p></blockquote><p>When kids don't have any idea, any domain they choose to specialize is good because the only things stopping the kid are hard work and determination. It's unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.</p><p>Most children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That's because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent's perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.</p><p>In the end, I believe it's a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/blog/happiness-is-success">previous blog post</a>, I had discussed about how happiness is a measure of success. </p><p>But one might ask, how do you attain happiness? </p><p>This is one of the questions that humans have posed for ages. It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I'll just share what I think.</p><p>My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. </p><p>One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. </p><p>Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. </p><p>Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. </p><p>As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other's ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.</p><p>A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"A Man's Search For Meaning"</a> is in order here: "In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice." </p><p>Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it's this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What our parents have taught us from a young is mostly true. Hard work, determination
and focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn
to become successful.</p><p>However, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions
our parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.
There is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing
goals and goals are largely individualistic.</p><p>It's not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it's important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make.
This reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even
having an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.</p><p>Just like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.</p><p>As you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. </p><p>Of course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.</p><p>They act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don't get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. </p><p>With the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The only panacea to this information overload is to create</a>. Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.</p><p>When you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.</p><p>This is what I believe true success looks like.</p><blockquote><p>Inspired by reading a Kindle sample of "Think Like A Monk" by Jay Shetty</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often like to look at the end result and awe at the mastery involved in creating that result. However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann's Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like "behind the scenes".</p><p>I'll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I'm going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to "unlock" your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning">Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As I've read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of "connecting the dots" in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conversing">Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn't that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can't fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that's the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coding">Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn't come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn't undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn't fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That's why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren't going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exercising">Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="writing">Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process of rewriting</a></p><p>Even that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That's a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>All the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the "focussed mode" of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the "diffused mode" and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It's tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don't seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I've done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an "emergent" phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Podcast link//freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Podcast link: <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence-repeat/</a></p><p>I just tuned into an episode of one of my favourite podcasts "No Stupid Questions" by Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner. I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.</p><p>My own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="forgetting-curve">Forgetting curve<a class="hash-link" href="#forgetting-curve" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>That is because our brain has a "forgetting curve" just as it has a "learning curve": you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.
The dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-intention">The role of intention<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-of-intention" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Your brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. </p><p>However, it's unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-importance-of-context">The importance of context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Angela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="much-room-for-misinterpretation">Much room for misinterpretation<a class="hash-link" href="#much-room-for-misinterpretation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. </p><p>As Stephen says towards the end, "My job is to write and the reader's job is to read and forget". In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work.</p>]]></content>

This becomes self-evident as we observe the people around us during the commute, glued to their mobile devices and unaware of their surroundings. </p><p>Secular mindfulness, the mindfulness techniques that are not specific to any particular religion, allow you to focus on the internal sensations of the body by observing them in a non-judgemental way.</p><p>To highlight the benefits of integrating mindfulness into your daily life, Crystal has shared the experiences of students that have taken CFG1010 who are aware of the overpowering influence of technology in their lives and how they became more attentive during the class after practising mindfulness techniques. A similar effect has been observed amongst employees who have attended group mindfulness sessions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skill-2-self-awareness">Skill 2: Self-Awareness<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-2-self-awareness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Without self-awareness, we will not be able to regulate our emotions and understand why we behave the way we do. This can lead us to subconsciously get into negative patterns of thinking and live life on autopilot. Having great internal self-awareness allows us to have better control over the four main constituents of self: the mind, our body, our soul and spirituality. Internal self-awareness can be cultivated by practising mindfulness during different activities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skill-3-empathy">Skill 3: Empathy<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-3-empathy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Empathy is what makes us human. It allows us to see the world from another's perspective. When we can apply this skill successfully in our careers and our life in general, the results are magical.</p><p>There are 3 modes of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cognitive empathy</strong>: Cognitive empathy means that we can understand what the other is going through but does not necessarily mean that we share this empathy. This can be employed successfully by manipulators to read you like a book and trick you into doing what they want. This need not always be used negatively though, as doctors for example can distance themselves from the pain that the patient is going through even as they understand it very precisely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional empathy</strong>: Emotional empathy, on the other hand, means that we experience the same emotions that the other person is going through due to the "mirror neurons" in our brain. This is what causes us to wince in pain when we see someone hurting badly on the television, even as we are not going through the same pain ourselves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compassionate empathy</strong>: Compassionate empathy takes this a step further, where we strongly feel that we should do all we can in our power to reduce the suffering of the other person.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skill-4-complex-communication">Skill 4: Complex Communication<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-4-complex-communication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Complex Communication is required to give the right feedback to the people we work with. This involved conveying our emotional state as accurately as we can. It is complex because we are not always aware of the inner workings of the black box that is our mind, which is influenced by different moods due to different factors such as the time of the day, the weather and the events that have taken place up to the point. When it comes to others, this gets even worse because they are even harder to read. To master this skill, we need to tap on the other skills such as self-awareness and empathy.</p><p>In place of the "shit sandwich" model of giving feedback: negative feedback hidden within the layers of positive feedback, which may either downplay the negative feedback or seem facetious, the authors propose the SBIFI model: Situation, Behaviour, Impact, Future, In-Group.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Situation</strong>: Focus on one specific situation to give feedback on rather than resort to generalities such as "you always" or "you never". In general, humans are not very good at multitasking and this applies to digesting critical feedback as well. That is why focusing on one specific situation is essential for communicating what went wrong or what could be improved in a way that the person receiving feedback can take concrete action on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behaviour</strong>: Describe the person's behaviour as precisely as you can and mention that you felt that it was inappropriate for the situation. Do not include other people in this assessment by saying "All of us think that you should..." because what you feel may not apply universally. </p></li><li><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Let the person know the consequences of his actions on the behaviour of others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Future</strong>: Provide feedback in a way that helps the person reflect on ways he could improve.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-Group</strong>: Share the vision and mission of the organisation and how the work done by the person fits into it.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skill-5-adaptive-resilience">Skill 5: Adaptive Resilience<a class="hash-link" href="#skill-5-adaptive-resilience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Adaptive Resilience is perhaps one of the most important. In life, you are likely to face a lot of challenges and your success in part depends on the ability to adapt to them as well as persist through them. </p><p>To explain this concept, Crystal invokes the idea of the "fixed" and "growth" mindset proposed by Professor Carol Dweck from Stanford. </p><p>A fixed mindset leads you to believe that you cannot change and things will mostly remain as they are. This mindset can be developed due to a person's upbringing and personal circumstances.
A growth mindset, on the other hand, allows you to see the temporary nature of setbacks and work to learn and grow from them instead of resorting to learned helplessness. </p><p>This very much relates to the idea of growing your sphere of influence/control proposed by Stephen Covey in 7 Habits of Highly Successful People. A growth mindset may not help you succeed, as luck plays a huge role as well, but a fixed mindset is almost certain to lead to failure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-takeaways">My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I had first come to know Crystal and Greg Lim Lange, when I had taken the CFG1010: Roots and Wings module during the first semester of my studies at NUS. I found it a nice detour from the regular course workload that I was taking as it was non-technical and introduced concepts that were quite novel. </p><p>However, at the back of my mind, I harboured a notion that was prevalent amongst most other students in technical fields: what was needed to succeed and ultimately land the interviews that would get me my internships and my first job after college would be my technical skills and not the "soft skills". Hence, I could not appreciate the wisdom behind the ideas covered in the book (a compilation of the ideas also covered in the course).</p><p>I have acquired a renewed taste in this book with each subsequent reading and this will most likely be the book that I will keep referring to at different stages of my career, to do a sort of rain check that will help me see where I am at and where I want to be. Through my own experiences, I have come to realise just how important the skills mentioned in the book truly are. </p><p>As famously said by Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who has been cited a couple of times in the book, "IQ Gets You Hired, EQ Gets You Promoted". These are, I believe, so important that you should seek a role where you can hone these skills if you can, even as a job applicant.</p><p>It's quite hard to appreciate the significance of these skills especially as an undergraduate student specializing in an academically rigorous technical field where much emphasis is still placed on the "hard skills". However, you can't just sustain with the "hard skills" because you need to work with others, manage your own emotions and also craft a productive lifestyle around your work in the long run.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goodreads link//www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you</a></p><p>In this book written in 2012, Cal Newport, a professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University, distils his career advice into a set of four rules that centre around the concept of being "so good they can't ignore you".</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion">Rule #1: Don't follow your passion<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The main aim of this book is to take on the "passion hypothesis": follow your passion and the money will come. This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rule-2-build-skills">Rule #2: Build Skills<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-2-build-skills" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. </p><p>To build career capital, Cal describes the necessary "craftsman mindset". Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.</p><p>To build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. </p><p>Of course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rule-3-the-importance-of-control">Rule #3: The Importance of Control<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-3-the-importance-of-control" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Through this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. </p><p>The former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don't have a backup plan. </p><p>The second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don't know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it's likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission">Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>According to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the "adjacent possible", a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-important-concepts">Other important concepts<a class="hash-link" href="#other-important-concepts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets.
According to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. </p><p>When you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don't have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-takeaways">My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>What I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it's hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. </p><p>I do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goodreads link//www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Goodreads link: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860365-learn-like-a-pro</a></p><p>Even though I have graduated from college, I felt that it was necessary for me to read this book to become an effective lifelong learner. I had taken the popular MOOC "Learning How To Learn" taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn't fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. </p><p>Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way">Increase focus the Pomodoro Way<a class="hash-link" href="#increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="get-enough-sleep">Get enough sleep<a class="hash-link" href="#get-enough-sleep" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seperate-editing-from-writing">Seperate editing from writing<a class="hash-link" href="#seperate-editing-from-writing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="make-your-learning-active">Make your learning active<a class="hash-link" href="#make-your-learning-active" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simulate-the-exam-conditions">Simulate the exam conditions<a class="hash-link" href="#simulate-the-exam-conditions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy">Exercise regularly and eat healthy<a class="hash-link" href="#exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="follow-the-instructions">Follow the instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#follow-the-instructions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interleave-your-studies">Interleave your studies<a class="hash-link" href="#interleave-your-studies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test</p><p>Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I started to think more about writing online, I often wondered to myself about how people would write before the printing press was invented. The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled "Memory Overload". It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer's Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn't sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven't erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn't stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer's data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer's ideas.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms. </p><p>That's why most tech companies have teams managing load balancing on their servers and perform stress testing to ensure the reliability of the systems. The engineers working in these departments inevitably have to work for longer hours or even odd hours to support systems when they eventually crash. </p><p>This is an example of how an innocuous action like posting can have a larger scale impact on the lives of others. It is perhaps captured best through the metaphor of the "Butterfly Effect". Such effects have probably panned out on a bigger scale to phenomena such as climate change that can be described as hyperobjects, events spanning across a large amount of space and time that are a complex intermingling of many different interactions. </p><p>We have to be kind to ourselves as a species because we are not good at predicting the future. That's just not the way we are engineered. With time, we have evolved to set long term goals and work towards them, but we've to spend most of the time looking out for what lies ahead of us in the immediate future.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In modern societies, humans spend a large amount of their time at work. By rough estimates, a human on average spends 80,000 hours in his or her career. That's a very long time.</p><p>One of the major reasons that humans have to work is that they need to earn a livelihood. Another equally important reason, however, is that solving any problem of significant magnitude requires a considerable amount of investment of resources like time and money that only groups can pool together.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, it makes sense to pick a career that is likely to create the most impact. This is the idea behind the 80000 hours initiative affiliated with the Centre of Effective Altruism at the University of Oxford.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, people do not always have the freedom to choose the career that is best aligned with their goals. One of the reasons can be barriers to entry for a profession. But another more fundamental reason is perhaps the lack of financial freedom. </p><p>It seems as though society values money a lot, even though time may actually be even more precious than money because it is a non-renewable resource.&nbsp;That is why it is important to take the decision about your career path seriously. </p><p>That said, the best career path need not necessarily be a straight line. There is a TED talk that I came across recently which discusses the same idea. The speakers Sarah Ellis and Hellen Tupper challenge the conventional wisdom that you need to climb the career ladder to achieve success in your profession. Hence, a career needs to be evaluated from a different perspective in modern times.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The learning experience in college experience is very different from the learning experience in schools. You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this digital age, children are exposed to a vast amount of information through the internet. On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent's advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a conversation between Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens, the creator of the popular YouTube channel VSauce, over the Lex Fridman podcast. They were discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, the simulation hypothesis and the flat earth hypothesis.</p><p>One of the interesting points that was brought up during the conversation was that there are special conditions required for revolutionary scientific ideas to come about. The revolutionaries who come up with such ideas often have to find clever ways to lead others towards those ideas, as such ideas often challenge the conventional wisdom and risk drawing backlash from the scientific community at large.</p><p>This made me think: Is it always necessary to challenge the conventional wisdom? It seems like revolutionary ideas are born through mechanisms that do precisely that. However, as Stevens pointed out, there is good reason to be suspicious of ideas that go against widely held beliefs, as these beliefs are often borne out of extensive experimentation and validation. Popular culture has been fascinated with depicting rebels as the ones who ultimately end up making a difference in the world, but the truth about scientific progress lies somewhere between rebellion and conformity. One cannot expect to have new ideas unquestioned, but the questioning must be done in an open-minded manner. In the realm of science, as Stevens quipped, "Science does not prove anything. It just reduces the uncertainty". A new idea cannot be conclusively debunked until and unless it has been proven to do so and that cannot be often be done until a much later point of time.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Self-help books generally encode principles that help you chart goals for your life. Once you have determined those goals, you can live life in a way that aligns with those goals. Self-help books also provide ideas that will help you improve. The improvement generally comes from within - the books primarily serve to spark motivation.</p><p>Once you start reading a couple of self-help books, you may notice some key ideas and concepts that cut across the different books. For example, as I read Cal Newport's ideas covered in his book Deep Work through his blog, I can grasp key ideas, like building good habits and working on a limited number of things but doing them well, that help set you up for success. The importance of habits have been discussed in a couple of other self-help books as well. It seems like a part of building the "Character Ethic" that Stephen Covey has mentioned in his book "7 Habits of Highly Successful People".</p><p>In my opinion, it is good to get an idea of what the self-help book you plan to read has to offer. This can be done by quickly analyzing the contents of the book through its chapters, summary and reviews. Read only those books that seem to resonate with you and reinforce the ideas you believe are important to incorporate in your life. The end result should be that you are able to concretely put into practice what you have learnt from the books.</p><p>If you start to read more and more self-help books, you may find yourself getting into a consumption pattern similar to reading posts from different self-help gurus on social media platforms. You feel like you learn a lot but you do not get much benefit out of the reading.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Education equips individuals with basic literacy skills like reading and writing. While the primary aim of modern education is to help students develop a set of core competencies or "hard skills", it also helps them furnish soft skills like communication and teamwork that are becoming more and more critical in the workplace.</p><p>The value of education is intrinsic: you simply cannot judge the value of education by looking at the return of investment. This is because, you cannot pre-emptively determine how your learning in prior years will become relevant later on in life.</p><p>Education enhances the quality of your mind. Having a well-developed mind is essential for developing the cognitive abilities needed to make sense of the vast array of information we are exposed to in the current times.</p><p>Many of the problems in the current education systems around the world arise due to an over emphasis on testing and grades. Teachers are obligated to complete the topics within the curriculum on time. To ensure that students are learning at the right pace, they have to assign homework. Sometimes, the amount of homework assigned becomes too much and this leaves the student less time to engage with other activities that are important for their development. It is important to re-evaluate current education models so that we can achieve a right balance and make education more holistic.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The modern world is filled with distractions. You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It's not like there weren't enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn't dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Through the term technology, I'm referring to a range of different porducts and services that have been made available to us through scientific progress. However in recent times, this term has started to be used in a more narrow sense, to describe computers like laptops and personal computers or devices in which computers have been embedded like mobile devices. </p><p>Technology has helped improve the lives of mankind. A comfortable lifestyle is no longer accessible just to the rich and elite but also within the reach of individuals that fall in the middle-income category.</p><p>However, there are pros and cons to anything that becomes a part of our daily lives. As the American economist Herbert Simon once said, "abundance of information creates a poverty of attention". The huge amount of content that is available on the internet has also become a source of distractions. Distractions prevent us from focussing on things that truly matter to us. When we end up sinking time into applications, we lose out and the businesses who have created these applications profit. </p><p>That is why it is important to change our relationship with technology. Rather than let it dictate our lives, we need to take charge of our time and attention, two of the most valuable resources we have, and use only the technologies that benefit us. This requires practicing digital minimalism: decluttering your digital life by getting rid of technologies that don't provide value.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 3 weeks, I've been trying to build an exercise habit. I usually get up around 6 in the morning. While I initially started with just Yoga exercises in the morning, I realized that I can make better use of my time by doing HIIT workouts first and then doing Yoga as part of the cool down routine.</p><p>An important requirement for getting started with an exercise routine and sticking with it is motivation. Why put in all that effort to grind it out, when you could easily be doing something else, like staying in bed longer or watching Netflix? My motivation behind building an exercise habit was improving my physical health. My full-time role as a QA Engineer requires me to sit down in front of my laptop and monitor for longer hours than I was used to as a student. It's very easy for me to become a couch potato if I don't work out. Exercising on a daily basis helps me counter the effects of sitting down on the work desk for longer periods of time.</p><p>Settling into an exercise routine teaches you the importance of sticking to a habit. As a reward loop is essential for habit formation, you need to create an incentive after you have completed a workout. That way, when you feel like quitting once the going gets tough, you at least have that incentive to look forward to. For me, that incentive is the healthy breakfast that follows my workout.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I generally don't watch that much sports, but it's the Olympics season so I wanted to catch some of the action. As I switch on the channel broadcasting the Olympics only after work ends at 7 pm, I was only able to watch the swimming event.</p><p>It was amazing to see how the athletes, so lithe and graceful in their movements, rugged in physique, competing down to the wire.</p><p>As a Singaporean, I was looking forward to the 100m and 200m Butterfly heats where the participants from Singapore, Zheng Wen Quah and Joseph Schooling were competing to qualify for the semi finals. A lot of hopes rested on the shoulders of Joseph Schooling in particular, who had broken the Olympic Record during his gold medal run in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>Unfortunately, both of them did not manage to qualify. To make matters worse, Joseph Schooling was the last one to finish the race amongst the participants in his section. The disappointment did not sink in until the next day as I read Rohit Brijnath's article in the Straits TImes on Joseph's showing.</p><p>To me, Olympics is a treat to watch not only because of the intensity of the competition but because I can see the principles of hard work and perservance so clearly demonstrated during the live event. This year's event was especially challenging one thanks to COVID-19. Even if only a few would go on to qualify and only 3 would bag medals, it is a great accomplishment just to be able to compete at the Olympics. Being able to shrug off the defeat and move on is a testament to the indomitable human spirit as wins and losses are a part and parcel of sports.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack &amp; Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.</p><p>As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.</p><p>Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.</p><p>You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That's where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.</p><p>To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It appears as though every human being on this planet ultimately seeks to be happy. As most of us will be aware through our personal experiences though, it is impossible to achieve everlasting happiness. Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.</p><p>It is hard to quantify happiness, since happiness is a state of the mind. Also, happiness is relative. You are likely to feel happier on days when your mood is uplifted or even normal as compared to days when you have gone through a rough patch.</p><p>There are different sources of happiness. Some find happiness in their work. Some find happiness through connecting with their loved ones. Others find happiness through gaining wealth and other materialistic possessions.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the happiest people are those that are the most wealthy. However, money can also be a source of stress. The rich are often unsure whether the friends they have are true friends or merely friends of their money. Studies measuring the happiness quotient also seem to indicate that happiness tends to increase with income levels but only uptil an inflection point, where the curve then tapers off.</p><p>In my opinion, the happiest people are the ones who are able to remain focussed on the present instead of worrying excessively about what the future holds or remaining stuck with the regrets of the past. They are able to manage their expectations realistically and maintain a healthy balance between their social and work lives.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Youngsters like me are always on a look out for advice that can help us make the best use of our time and set ourselves up for the future. Advice from elders are usually packed with insights. They wish to convey information that they think is important for us youngsters to know. This way we don't have to reinvent the wheel and go through the same struggles they did.</p><p>Sometimes, I also find a tinge of regret hidden in the advice. The alternate paths they could have taken but did not, either due to their own inhibitions or due to the circumstances, are often the cause for this regret.</p><p>As a result, I posed myself this question: Why do we have regrets? To me, it seems quite natural for us humans to feel disappointed if things don't work out as well as expected, especially since opportunities abound in the modern world and there are multiple paths to success. In such a case, doing a cost benefit analysis to prune out unfavourable paths seems like a pragmatic approach that also makes you feel more empowered.</p><p>However, it is infeasible to attach an opportunity cost to each decision. It fools you into boiling down life into an accountancy game, whereas life is complex.</p><p>This line of reasoning may help you rationalize your regrets: with the resources and knowledge available at the time, the decisions you took were the best you could have taken. It is easy to connect the dots in hindsight, but that's due to our hindsight bias.</p>]]></content>

However, now as a fresh graduate who has stepped into the working world, I have been thinking more about how a 9-to-5 job seems to have almost become a rite of passage since the Industrial Age.</p><p>To be fair, there are different types of occupations in modern society. Hence, not everyone really works regular hours during a designated work week. Some employees are required to work on night shifts or alternate full day shifts, while others may have flexible working hours.</p><p>However, as more industries are pivoting towards regular hours, it's important to ask this question: should companies revise their working schedules or continue to stick to the status quo? I believe that is it best if the management of a company can assess its own situation holistically and follow what works best for the organisation as a whole, rather than having to follow what is the agreed upon norm for the insustry. As demonstrated in the case of Iceland, where companies are moving toward four day work weeks, governments also have an important role to play. Going forward, this will be seen as an essential component of employee welfare. There isn't a one size fits all approach to this dilemma, but an approach that adapts as per the demands of different roles. Companies will need to find workarounds that preserve the integrity of the organisation if different groups of employees have different working hours.</p>]]></content>

Some will feel minor, like bumps on an otherwise smooth road, while others can be major setbacks. As a human, it is natural to experience dejection after you face failures, especially if they keep coming.  The mistakes you make during failures are often alternate paths towards your goals and you find the right path only after several iterations. Learning from those mistakes is what helps us improve and grow.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Try to think of all the things you do when you wake up in the morning: brush your teeth, take a morning shower, catch up on the news, eat breakfast. How many of these things do you do consciously and how many of them have become a part of your routine? An introspection of our daily routines makes us realise how much of our lifestyle is habitual, built up over a long time.</p><p>Habits can be both good and bad. Tapping into insights from neuroscience can help you undo those habits that do not benefit you and create new ones that will help enrich your life. The actions required to carry out these tasks, no matter how complex, get recorded in a region of our long-term memory known as the Basal Ganglia. As a result, we can fetch the information required for these tasks effortlessly from our brain. </p><p>One of the key elements of developing any habit is practice. For the actions to be stored in our memory effectively, we need to be able to repeat them a sufficient number of times. Another important element of developing a habit is to create a positive reward loop around it. Thinking of how the habit fits into the long term picture will help you stick with it when the going gets tough. Last but not the least, have a plan of action for how you will go about forming the habit and what you will do if that does not work out. This will also help build up the resilience that is needed for habit formation.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since high school, I have fallen behind on my reading habit. After graduating from college though, I've come to realize that it is important to inculcate a reading habit.</p><p>Reading exposes you to the ideas espoused by different authors. While reading up on topics that you have expertise in will benefit you from a career perspective, it can also be illuminating to read works from other areas. For example, a lot of people like to read self help books. These often emphasize timeless principles that can be applied to different areas of your life to improve them. Some of the self-help books that I look forward to reading are Deep Work and Digital Minimalism, both written by Cal Newport as well as Atomic Habits by James Clear.</p><p>Reading, however, becomes effective only if you can apply those key ideas to enrich your life. That is how you actively learn from the material, like you would when you read the course materials for your examinations. The key difference is that you are aiming for a different long term goal: self-improvement.</p><p>Reading is also important for aspiring writers, because it allows them to generate the ideas they need to convert into writing. A handy tip that I have come across is that you need to strike a balance between how much you consume and how much your produce, with a good rule of thumb being that the time spent on the former does not exceed the time spent on the latter, especially as you are starting out.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Patience is a personality trait enshrined within the morals of stories that most of us have grown up with. On a personal level, it's something that I hope to build up with time.</p><p>It's often said that millennials and Gen-Z ers have become impatient as they have grown up in the lap of luxury afforded to them by the technological advances made in the 21st century. Like most statements of this nature, this is also a tantalizing generalization. It's not that surprising though, to see people of the older generation bemoan this apparent truth. Technological progress has indeed widened the gulf between the generations. The whole new world of opportunities afforded to us has made us impatient for results. </p><p>Why then is patience so important, especially in these times? This is because the goals we strive to attain for are mostly long term. Whether its' a good home, a loving family or stable financial wealth we are talking about, success don't come about in a jiffy. Being cliched here, but it takes blood, sweat and tears to build all of these.</p><p>This is the ethic that our parents have been trying inculcate since young, and it's often when you truly mature that you realize why they have been doing so. When you invest in key areas of growth in your life, you cannot always expect quick returns. You have to wait, often for a long period of time, before you see your investments bearing fruit. Patience is a virtue that will help you take on the challenges in your life and eventually tide over them because it helps you see the bigger picture.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love to sleep. I mean, who doesn't honestly? At the same time, I'm also quite fussy about my sleep. If I get more sleep than I need, I feel like I'm being lazy. On the other hand, if I sleep too less, I end up feeling more tired. I've been trying for that sweet spot of 7 hours.</p><p>Of course, different people have different requirements. If you can subsist on less sleep, then go ahead by all means. At the end of the day, you know what's best for your own body.</p><p>What's important is that you don't skimp on the hours that your body actually needs. If this starts to become a habit, it's time to introspect. Is this habit a result of huge workload or poor time management?</p><p>One of the main reasons this can happen is that you are spending more time on activities you shouldn't like being on your phone. Not only is your phone's blue light bad for your sleeping habit, but your phone time eats away at the time you need to do other things which are more important. In the end, you have to do those anyway, so this pushes back your sleeping time.</p><p>One helpful suggestion for getting enough sleep is creating a sleep routine. Once your body gets used to going to bed and waking up at the same time, it becomes a habit. You may even realize that you don't need an alarm clock to get up any more.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was in college, I didn't use to give much thought to how I should plan out my day. It isn't surprising, given that the nature of college life is hectic and variable. The workload for the semester changes depending on the number of credits you need to clear, what specialization you wish to pursue, and in general what your goals are for that semester.</p><p>However, as a college graduate who has now joined the workforce, it's essential for me to adhere to a daily routine. This is because work starts and ends every day at about fairly the same time and there are other tasks I need to do as part of my routine, such as writing, for example. </p><p>Other than that, I also feel that the routine is what will give me the strength to persist with longer term goals, especially when the going gets tough. If the day shapes out to be haphazard, it will eventually impact the quality of my life.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I looked up Cal Newport's daily routine recently. The reason I did so is that I'm impressed with all the work he has done outside his full-time job as a Computer Science professor, which in itself is a demanding job. </p><p>As a result, I came upon a website called mymorningroutine.com. This website provides transcripts of conversations that the team behind the My Morning Routine magazine had with about 343 professionals who have achieved success in their respective endeavours, from writing to entrepreneurship. </p><p>It would be fallacious to say that all of these individuals owe their success primarily to their morning routines, as that is inferring causation from correlation. However, reading through some of these interviews has reinforced my belief that a routine, as boring as it sounds, is indeed an ingredient for success.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, I started reading a book called "Learn Like A Pro" by Barbara Oakley. I had taken her course "Learning How To Learn", which was one of the most popular MOOCs on Coursera at the time. </p><p>Even though the course had a lot of useful tips for students, I did not end up applying those in my own college studies at NUS, which I suspect is one of the reasons I did not fare well.</p><p>One of the tips that Barbara shares in the book is breaking your study time into chunks using the Pomodoro technique. Even when it seems like a task takes variable amounts of time to complete, I'd highly suggest sticking to this technique. </p><p>This is because 25 minutes is the perfect amount of time to maintain focus on the task, and completing a Pomodoro gives your brain that dopamine boost it needs to stay motivated, especially if the task at hand is arduous. </p><p>Another important aspect of the Pomodoro technique is that it allows you to schedule breaks in between your work. Taking breaks is important for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it forages all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode where it can make connections between disparate strands of information to give you a higher-level picture, or a mental model, based on that information.</p><p>Even as I have graduated from college, I have come to realise that it's important for me to improve my learning performance. Hence, I would recommend this book to learners of all ages so that you can better understand how the brain works and apply insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology to take charge of your own learning.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of May, I've been cutting back on my social media time. There are two main factors that guided this decision:</p><ol><li>The impact of passive consumption of social media on my mental health </li><li>The time that I was sinking into these applications, which I could be using fruitfully elsewhere.</li></ol><p>Reading up on some research which suggests that applications like Instagram create negative body image perceptions amongst teenage girls and discussing about the prevalence of VAST, a condition similar to ADHD, amongst kids who have been exposed to social media from an early age has led me to this question: Is social media doing us more harm than good?</p><p>Like most other questions of a similar nature, the answer is not straightforward. Social media applications have had a positive impact by creating online communities that contribute to the knowledge base on the internet. They can bring value to a lot of people, in their personal lives or careers.</p><p>However, I hope people can take a step back and reassess their relationship with this technology. In my own case, I feel that it is useful to post my atomic essays on Twitter for accountability but I've set up a feed-blocker extension on my browser so that I don't get hooked on it again. This may not be feasible for others, but they can work out some other arrangement that works for them. What I'd like to see is a bottom up relationship with social media where it aligns with personal goals rather than a top down relationship driven by emotions like FOMO.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'll be the first to admit, I have a lot of work to do to improve my relationship with boredom. I don't necessarily think that boredom is something that must be avoided at all costs, but it does make me uncomfortable. It lulls me into the false trap of thinking that I'm not being productive.</p><p>Over the course of time, I've come to realize that this notion is inaccurate and can even be detrimental. That is why when I first heard Cal Newport speak about how boredom can in fact be crucial when you are doing deep work, I felt that his words resonated with me. </p><p>To be fair, Newport says that he does not lionize boredom the way some others studying original thinkers do. However, he says that there is enough research literature that points towards doing the boring "deep work" and then taking a break from it to do something else, something mundane or ritualistic, as being key for generating great ideas. In such cases, the brain works in the background even as the human body is carrying out other tasks not remotely connected to the field of thought that the brain is pursuing.</p><p>When you are working on any long term project, you are bound to go through stretches of boredom followed by periods of insight. Trying to tackle the boredom by switching to another window to catch up on email, Slack notifications or the social media feed leaves the brain with insufficient time to think about the problems that we wish to solve. This has reshaped my belief that boredom can actually be a good thing and should be embraced for longer-term success.</p>]]></content>

Overflowing email has acquired the proportions of a first-world problem that many of us face in this digital age, but it doesn't have to be a nightmare.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've viewed the growth in human population over the last century in a negative light. I remember discussing this issue with a relative who brought up the point about how the population has grown from less than a billion in the 1800s to a whopping figure of 7.9 billion, quadrupling over the last century. </p><p>He described it as the elephant in the room, the issue that was not being discussed with as much fervour as say climate change. A growing population meant more mouths to feed and this would eventually place constraints on governments who have to cater to the demands of the populace. </p><p>In particular, he mentioned how the progress that India had made in terms of GDP growth seemed to be evened out by the population growth. In view of these issues, the efforts made by governments to tackle population growth such as China's former one-child policy and the two-child policy now being promoted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India seem more than welcome.</p><p>Watching a Kurzgesagt video on overpopulation however, changed my perspective on it. Instead of focussing on the doom and gloom that is generally associated with a burgeoning population, the video addressed the trends in demographic transition that have emerged in developing countries like Bangladesh, which mirror those that had been seen in the now-developed countries like Britain post-industrialisation. </p><p>Due to improvements in healthcare, growing life spans and more educated citizens, the birth rates have started to decline and the population growth has more or less stabilised. This paints a more positive picture of the road ahead, if other countries lagging behind begin to follow this trend, with help from the developed countries.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let's face it, all of us are surrounded by a lot of information right now, produced by a large number of creators that exist within the digital landscape. Having access to such a large amount of information at our fingertips gives us the impression that we are becoming smarter. But are we really? Or is all that information confusing us instead?</p><p>In a recent conversation with a friend, I shared with her why I had decided to limit my social media usage. </p><p>One of the reasons why I did so is because I noticed that my relationship with social media had started to change in college and took a turn for the worst after the pandemic. Another reason that inspired to me to make this change was an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science professor at the Georgetown University who writes about the intersection of tech and culture. He advocates quitting social media altogether and emphasises the need for digital minimalism required for to do "deep work", or long periods of focused work with minimal distractions.</p><p>I know that it's impractical for a lot of people to quit social media altogether, especially those whose work relies heavily on it. I find Newport's watered down stance more useful in this regard: Spend some time away from your devices to reassess your relationship with technology. Pick the tools that are in alignment with your goals. </p><p>The way I see it, this will establish a bottom up relationship with technology driven by personal needs rather than a top down relationship where you end up adding more apps that seem useful but just aren't.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first started to contemplate the idea of whether reality is a simulation as I reflected upon the complexity of human life and the history of mankind. </p><p>Two key events sparked this line of thought: reading Sapiens, a magnum opus written by the celebrated historian Yuval Noah Harari, as well as discussing about meditating on the nature of reality with a dear friend. It's how we as a human society have reached where we are right now, achieving technological progress at an ever-accelerating pace, that has perplexed me.</p><p>I'm a theist but I've not really subscribed to one religious view completely, even as a practicing Hindu. I used to conceptualise God as a supernatural force that permeates the very fabric of the cosmos. </p><p>Now though, the idea that we may be living in a simulation opens up entertaining possibilities. Are we characters being controlled by players of an arcade game? Are we a hive mind that is being controlled by a computer? Or perhaps all of this has originated in a single mind that has been coerced to live in a dream?</p><p>Of course, none of the questions I have posed here are novel. In fact, they have been inspired from popular fiction such as the Matrix, Bladerunner, the Truman Show and Dark City that has delved into this topic. However, my personal beliefs have been reinforced as I view the world around me, whose many aspects I used to take for granted earlier. </p><p>For those interested to learn more about this topic, I'd recommend reading the seminal paper on the Simulation Hypothesis authored by Nick Bostrom and a book with a similar title written by Rizwan Virk, a former MIT graduate student and professional game developer.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Money can be viewed primarily as a medium of exchange for goods and services. As history goes, different forms of money have evolved from the barter system where one person, the buyer, offers goods or services to the other person, the seller in return for goods or services of equivalent value. </p><p>For such a system to succeed, there are two key requirements that must be met. First, both parties involved must be fairly acquainted with each other for the exchange to take place. Second, the exchange must mutually benefit them in a way that they perceive as being of equivalent value. </p><p>As one can see, such a system quickly becomes cumbersome and unsustainable over time. Hence, it was necessary for humans to come up with a replacement that would allow people to transact without having these two key requirements in place.</p><p>Today, money plays that role since the buyer does not need to provide anything of material value to the seller apart from monetary payment. In return the buyer is expected to participate in the economy through some way, typically through the employment, where he ends up providing a valuable good or service to others in the company in which he is employed or to consumers directly if he is self-employed. </p><p>There are exceptions to this rule, but the engine of modern economy treads forward when the balance is maintained, as the supply meets the demand.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I have had issues with self-confidence and compared myself with others, I was naturally drawn towards this question: Is comparison always a negative tendency? </p><p>Well, as in other matters in life, there is no straightforward answer because comparison can have positive as well as negative consequences.</p><p>I was listening to an episode on the podcast No Stupid Questions recently, where the hosts Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner were addressing the same question. Angela said that it is important to evaluate the tendency to compare from an evolutionary psychology standpoint. </p><p>Humans tend to compare their lives with lives of those who seem to be doing better because they wish to improve their lives. This is known as upward social comparison. This can be positive if the person does not get discouraged by others' accomplishments, but tends to have detrimental effects on the person's mental health if done too often.</p><p>On the other hand, a person may also experience schadenfreude, taking joy at someone's suffering. This is an example of downward social comparison. It rarely brings any benefit, since it does not improve the person's own wellbeing and may make the person feel guilty for experiencing such emotions instead.</p><p>I would conclude by saying that everyone needs to introspect and control this tendency if it is harming them. This is easier said than done, but you can only grow as a person if you seek to improve by competing with yourself, not with others.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There comes a time after a student graduates where he reflects back upon his journey through the undergraduate days, usually right after his graduation. These are the four things that I wish I had known as an undergraduate student back in college.</p><p>First, I wish I hadn't gotten into the rat race to achieve stellar grades or bag prestigious internships at the top companies, just out of peer pressure. As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I'd instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they'd likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.</p><p>Second, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.</p><p>Third, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.</p><p>Last, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual's perspective. People will always have some regrets when they reflect back upon their college days. So take this advice with a pinch of salt and enjoy the college journey while you can!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first started coding in 11th Standard when I took up a course on Computer Science, at the age of 16. I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn’t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn’t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I’d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor’s and Master’s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn’t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn’t need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I’d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the “sink or swim” methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren’t running an “Apple Genius Bar” service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven’t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through <a href="https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Spittel’s tips to beginners</a>, as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was announced on 11th June in Singapore that <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-aged-12-to-39-can-book-vaccination-appointments-from-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those in the age group of
12 to 39</a>
could register interest to sign up for vaccine appointments by filling in
their particulars in a <a href="https://preregister.vaccine.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple registration form.</a></p><p>As my parents had already gotten vaccinated, I filled up this form as soon
as I could. After registering successfully, MOH contacted me via SMS to
provide the personalized booking code I needed to get an appointment at
one of the <a href="https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinics or vaccination centers</a> for the vaccine of my choice. At this point, citizens have
been given preference, so it may take longer for other Singaporeans to
receive this SMS.</p><p>Another thing to take note is that there are fewer slots available for
booking for the Pfizer vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine. I
believe that this is because more doses of Pfizer are being administered
to the children in the age group of 12-17 who can only take the Pfizer
vaccine. Other reasons could be that Pfizer has slightly
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher efficacy</a> and those vaccinated with Pfizer have shown <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-more-opting-for-pfizer-vaccine-despite-longer-wait-than-for-moderna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milder side-effects</a>.</p><p>However, I decided to sign up for a slot at the Buona Vista CC to get the
Moderna shots even though it is relatively further away from my house as
compared to the Bukit Timah CC which was offering Pfizer, as I was getting
my shots at least a month earlier. It also seems that the Singapore
Government is encouraging Singaporeans to sign up for Moderna vaccines to
get their shots earlier, if possible. Getting a large section of the
population vaccinated is crucial to expediting the process of opening up,
as evidenced by examples of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/race-ahead-or-stay-cautious" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other developed nations reopening,
particularly in the West</a>.</p><p>I'm glad to announce that I got my first shot yesterday morning. The process was very smooth and the only time I had to wait was during the observation period lasting for about 30 minutes, which is the standard procedure to address serioud health concerns that may arise post vaccination.
Thankfully, I did not experience any of the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms mentioned in the
information sheet</a>, so I left immediately after the observation period was over. </p><p>Upon departure, along with a watter bottle to stay hydrated, I also
received two packs of surgical masks and a hand sanitizer. Even though my
family has sizeable stocks for both items, I was glad to see that they
were being distributed anyways so that all of us can continue to exercise
caution and stay safe. I would like to extend my thanks to the team from
the Fullerton Health Group who made the experience a pleasant one.</p><p>I would also like to address the concerns that people may have over drug
allergies. You should consult your regular doctor if you are unsure about
whether the vaccines are suitable for you given pre-exisitng drug
allergies. If you are aware of your allergies however, do cross check with
the ingredients mentioned in the info sheet for vaccine of choice:
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/moderna-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moderna</a> or <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/vaccination-matter/pfizer-vis-recipients-4-jun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pfizer</a>. Rest assured, you will be asked the required
questions to assess suitability of the vaccines during the booking as well
as before you take the vaccine.</p><p>Before you head off to your appointment, do make sure to bring along your NRIC/FIN card and wear attire with shorter sleeves so that it's easier to roll them up as you get your shot.</p><p>With this account of my experience getting my first shot of Moderna, I hope to encourage others to sign up for their slots and see the vaccination rates go up even higher so that we can ease more restrictions and take steps towards returning to normalcy as a nation. For further questions, doubts and concerns with regards to the vaccine, do make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs on the MOH Website</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, I'm feeling fine apart from a slight swelling in the arm. That seems perfectly normal, as I experience this even when I get a normal flu jab.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m by no means an expert at Leetcoding. Dynamic Programming problems in particular trip me up a lot. Nevertheless, I thought that I’d give it a try and share the way I go about solving a problem on LeetCode, especially if I’m not on a time crunch.</p><p>Truth be told, I’m not a big fan of the <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/366193/losing-motivation/688434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode grind</a>. This kind of an approach seems very similar to that required for solving Competitive Programming problems, where you are given the constraints on the inputs and outputs and you try to go for the most optimal solution that is not only efficient in terms of the order of time and space complexity i.e. the complexity of the solution expressed in the Big-O notation, but in terms of the limits imposed by the platform.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iXpPNZ0mu44gyJtomvg0lA.png" alt="Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem </figcaption></figure><p>Instead, I like to think of a LeetCode problem as it would more or less appear in an interview. Yes, you don’t have an interviewer with you to help clarify your doubts, but you can take note of them before you go ahead with designing a solution. It’s even better if you use LeetCode problems as you conduct mock interviews with your friends, since your friend can play the role of an interviewer. Start by looking through the problem statement and examples, then <b>write down your assumptions.</b></p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*S2BtsRUSVK1b7ZQsEuAjXw.png" alt="Problem constraints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem constraints </figcaption></figure><p>You should ideally do this even <b>before you look at the problem constraints</b>. This is because interviewers tend to pose the interview problem with slight ambiguity in order to give candidates the opportunity to ask for additional clarification. As a result, they would not generally start by specifying the problem constraints.</p><p>Once you have written down your assumptions about the problem, go ahead and check with the constraints of the problems to see if those assumptions are met. If they do, then that’s great. Otherwise, you may get additional insight about the kind of edge cases that you may have missed out on.</p><p>Once you have clarified your doubts and checked your assumptions, <b>try to come up with a brute force solution and not search for the most optimal solution at first</b>. For easy problems, this will usually work. However, even for the harder problems, coming up with something that at least works is better than nothing. Also, this brute force solution gives you an opportunity to discuss why this solution is inefficient and may serve as a guide to a better solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*P0Nhu_AfJ8fbeSSUDbIU2g.png" alt="Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints </figcaption></figure><p>The next step now is to optimize your brute force solution. This is often done with the help of some data structures or algorithmic patterns. If you are stuck at this stage, you can look at the Related Topics and Hints (if available) sections of the problem. This is sort of the equivalent of asking an interviewer for a hint. From what I know, most interviewers are ok with giving hints as long as you have explained your approach thus far and where you are stuck. If your interviewers are nice enough, they may be willing to help you out but don’t go about solving a problem with that assumption.</p><p>Hopefully, looking at those sections has given you a fair idea for an optimized solution. Once you have done that, take out your whiteboard (or if you are like me and don’t have a whiteboard, use pen and paper instead) and go about writing your solution over there. Trust me, the experience of “whiteboard coding” is much different from using an editor, not only because you miss out on the syntax highlighting and code completion, but also the core editing features such as copy and paste.</p><p>Once you have done that, run your solution through a couple of cases, which should be a mix of the given examples (for sanity check) and some other cases, including edge cases, that you have identified when you came up with the assumptions. Make sure you do this manually and not using the LeetCode console at first. This allows you to spot the bugs in your code and address the problems in your solution. This also saves you from having to edit your solution multiple times.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Rf4ufh6V7-3MQ0ozLH1NaA.png" alt="A solution with time and space complexity specified" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> A solution with time and space complexity specified </figcaption></figure><p>Once you are confident that your code works and is efficient to the best of your knowledge, write down the time and space complexity for your proposed solution. This way, you have a clear metric to demonstrate how the current solution is better than your previous solution and also discuss the tradeoffs should you have any alternate approaches.</p><p>Now that you have tried everything you possibly could to get to the best solution, it’s time to test your code with the cases that you have come up with. LeetCode premium users can make use of the debugger, but in my opinion, it’s best to stick to the console. This is because it is unlikely that you would be allowed to use a debugger for a real interview question. If you get an error for a particular case then try to go through solution again manually. If that still does not help you, you have no choice but to use logging techniques to debug your solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Discussion section for the sample problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Discussion section for the sample problem </figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Official solution for another problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center">Official solution for another problem</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, after all this hard work, if all your test cases have passed, just go ahead and submit your solution! If the solution has been accepted, well done. You can go ahead and post your solution in the Discuss section. You can also check out what others have posted or even have a look at the official solutions if they have been provided. Otherwise, you can see what test case has failed and address the problem(s) in your solution.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to work on the problem again from scratch. Chances are that you would have a fresh approach to look at the problem and that might do the trick! It’s important to remember that you learn from incorrect solutions as much (if not more) as you learn from the correct solutions.</p>]]></content>
