Just before writing this, I was leafing through some chapters
of the book ["Chanakya in Daily Life" by Radhakrishnan Pillai](https://www.amazon.com/Chanakya-Daily-Life-Radhakrishnan-Pillai/dp/8129144441).
This is one of the books that I instinctively know that I would keep coming back to over the years. It has distilled the 6,000 sutras from
[Chanakya's Arthashastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra) that cover a wide range of topics (over 1, 000 by
the author's estimation) into 3 components of life that are important
to everyone: personal, professional, and familial.

These are some of my takeaways from this book.

## Writing a book

A book is a major undertaking. It takes a minimum of 6 months to a year
of consistent writing once a rough outline is planned and a publisher
has accepted the proposal. Adding on top of that the other demands to ensure good book sales such as marketing it through various channels,
going through several rounds of editing and discussion with the publisher
and reaching out to beta readers for feedback, makes the journey seem even more daunting.

However, it's a journey worth undertaking because you are leaving something for posterity.
The author cites the example of the Arthashastra. If Chanakya had not
written it, the future generations would have been left bereft of its wisdom.

If the idea of a book sounds impractical, it may help to maintain a diary
or a blog instead. The best time to write is at night as you can reflect
upon the happenings of the day. A month of journaling provides a lot of material
in itself. Over the span of a year, you may have enough writing to fit into a book.

An instance that springs to mind is the Diary of Anne Frank. The diary
was a coping mechanism for a young girl who was trying to survive the atrocities
that the Holocaust heaped upon her family and friend, as Jews in Nazi Germany.
It not only bore testament to her indomitable spirit in the face of adversity,
but also provided interesting insights into the psyche of a teenager.

Her struggles would be relatable to a lot of people today, who have had to bear the
the brunt of a surge of relentless lockdowns due to the current pandemic.

## Listening to music

Music has the power to uplift your mood. In the past, kings would wake up to
the sound of royal music. Chanakya himself took great pains to
arrange the right kind of music, based on the king's moods. To do so,
he sought counsel from some of the best music composers in the kingdom.

Nowadays, there are a plethora of playlists available thanks to streaming platforms
like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/browse), and 
[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/). The key here is to be
mindful in curating a playlist for the day, keeping in mind the fluctuations
of mood over the course of the day.

For example, if you need to focus most intently during the morning, you should select soft music. Increase the intensity of the music
as the pace of work picks up.

## Developing a creative hobby

Apart from work, it is important to cultivate at least one or two hobbies
that keep you engaged. Without these, life can start to feel humdrum.

The best hobbies are the ones that involve some amount of creativity.
Writing, singing, dancing, cooking, and painting: all of these are creative
activities because they allow you to freely express yourself.

It may even be worthwhile to do [creative workouts](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/5-Minute-Creative-Workouts-Get-Your-Creativity-in-Shape/483111042) once in a while to
shake things up. These allow you to put your "creative muscles" to work.
Nothing is sadder than the demise of a creative hobby.

## Taking a power nap

While this may sound counterintuitive, sometimes taking a nap can be
a major productivity boost. The best time of the day for such "power naps"
is the afternoon. It may be difficult to work those into your schedule, especially
if you are overloaded with work, but try to make time for such naps
on occasion.

## Finding a mentor

In this digital age, we have all the information from around the
globe at our fingertips as they say. One can also find tons of "gurus"
on social media platforms that seem to dispense good advice for free.

The main barrier though is what information you can trust. Another
concern is that even information from trusted sources can be harmful, if
it is misinterpreted.

Hence, it is important to find mentors or guides in the areas of life
that you wish to succeed. Before you seek them out though, you need
to ascertain first whether these areas are indeed truly important to you.

The author mentions his example to illustrate this point. Due to the lack of formal training material on Chanakya's Arthashastra, he had to reach out to a Sanskrit scholar from the [Chinmaya mission](https://www.chinmayamission.com/) who could educate him on the meaning of the different sutras. 
This has allowed the author to craft this book, as well as several others, based on the
teachings from the Arthashastra.

The book covers over 70 topics, so there's a wealth of information
for anyone and everyone. There are simple yet powerful principles
to design a fulfilling life. I hope that my takeaways inspire more people
to pick up this book right away.
