Since the start of May, I've been cutting back on my social media time. There are two main factors that guided this decision:


1. The impact of passive consumption of social media on my mental health 
2. The time that I was sinking into these applications, which I could be using fruitfully elsewhere.


Reading up on some research which suggests that applications like Instagram create negative body image perceptions amongst teenage girls and discussing about the prevalence of VAST, a condition similar to ADHD, amongst kids who have been exposed to social media from an early age has led me to this question: Is social media doing us more harm than good?


Like most other questions of a similar nature, the answer is not straightforward. Social media applications have had a positive impact by creating online communities that contribute to the knowledge base on the internet. They can bring value to a lot of people, in their personal lives or careers.


However, I hope people can take a step back and reassess their relationship with this technology. In my own case, I feel that it is useful to post my atomic essays on Twitter for accountability but I've set up a feed-blocker extension on my browser so that I don't get hooked on it again. This may not be feasible for others, but they can work out some other arrangement that works for them. What I'd like to see is a bottom up relationship with social media where it aligns with personal goals rather than a top down relationship driven by emotions like FOMO.
