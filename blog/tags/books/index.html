This sounds like good advice at a surface level but it does not much have much foundation as Cal demonstrates by diving deeper into the examples of success stories that refute this hypothesis. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-2-build-skills"></a>Rule #2: Build Skills<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-2-build-skills" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the contrary, Cal proposes building your career not based on some pre-existing passion but rather through career capital. Career capital is defined as a set of rare and valuable skills that you can exchange for the kind of job that has a combination of these three desirable traits: respect, autonomy and control. </p><p>To build career capital, Cal describes the necessary &quot;craftsman mindset&quot;. Focus on what you can offer to the world and not what it has to offer you. Shifting focus to what you have to offer automatically gears you up to hone your craft through mastery.</p><p>To build career capital, you also need to have patience. Attaining mastery takes a significant investment of time, often in the magnitude of months and years, not days and weeks. </p><p>Of course, merely putting in the hours is not sufficient to set yourself on the path to success. Incorporating deliberate practice into the regimen is what sets the masters apart from the novices. This is akin to spaced repetition, where you create a routine to chunk at a demanding set of tasks over a while to boil something complex down into manageable constituents. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-3-the-importance-of-control"></a>Rule #3: The Importance of Control<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-3-the-importance-of-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Through this rule, Cal elaborates on the control trap. There are two scenarios: one when you have insufficient career capital and the other when you gain sufficient career capital. </p><p>The former situation brings forth the first control trap, where you jump towards opportunities for more control without backing them up with sufficient career capital in exchange. This is a risky gamble because while freedom is good it also creates more chances for failure and without career capital, you don&#x27;t have a backup plan. </p><p>The second situation is hard to distinguish from the first. This is because you don&#x27;t know whether the resistance to this freedom is guarding you against the risks from insufficient capital or holding you back from breaking the trap as it only works in your favour. Generally, if the people involved find value in your work and are willing to offer you an option that exchanges autonomy for more benefits, then it&#x27;s likely that they are tempting you to fall into the second control trap. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission"></a>Rule #4: The Importance of a Mission<a class="hash-link" href="#rule-4-the-importance-of-a-mission" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>According to Cal, what sets apart an interesting career is a mission. To have a mission, you must first have sufficient stores of career capital. Once you do that, you need to keep abreast of the developments in your field of expertise that occur in the space of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, a space where the cutting edge innovations arise from a spontaneous combination of events under the right circumstances.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="other-important-concepts"></a>Other important concepts<a class="hash-link" href="#other-important-concepts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In between, Cal also introduces other concepts such as the law of financial viability and the importance of making small bets.
According to the law of financial viability, you should use money as a neutral indicator of value. In other words, if you are exploring a new venture to get into in place of your existing one, consider working on it on the side and see if people are willing to invest the money into it that matches what you are already getting for the existing venture. If not, you should maybe reconsider your plans. </p><p>When you are faced with several options for an alternate venture, spend smaller amounts of time, say a month, on experiments that help you decide whether you want to invest in these so that you don&#x27;t have to take the plunge right away. By doing this, you are in a way viewing your career through the scientific lens as you test out different hypotheses. Pick the one that produces the best results.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="my-takeaways"></a>My takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#my-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What I liked about this book is how Cal reiterates the points he makes in each chapter through summaries. He effectively demonstrates the 4 rules by drawing from several examples in different fields: from performing arts to archaeology. The intended audience for this book is knowledge workers, so he mentions how it&#x27;s hard for them to see the importance of skill mastery in their work and how they instead substitute the cognitive strain caused by deliberate practice with the cognitive ease brought about by constantly checking emails. </p><p>I do agree with reviewers who mention that some of the examples cited may have been used as strawmen to attack the passion hypothesis, but I have found the ideas in this book to be quite instructive. The emphasis on stretching yourself and getting feedback in particular is important, as attaining mastery is not easy and requires a lot of dedication.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You - A Book Review" href="/blog/so-good-they-can&#x27;t-ignore-you-a-review"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review">Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 28, 2021 Â· 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Even though I have graduated from college, I felt that it was necessary for me to read this book to become an effective lifelong learner. I had taken the popular MOOC &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot; taught by Barbara Oakley on Coursera during my undergrad years. In that course, she had mentioned a lot of the topics that have been covered in this book as well. I believe that I hadn&#x27;t fared as well in college as I had hoped to because I did not apply concepts taught in the course to build good learning habits. </p><p>Here are the some of the biggest takeways from this book:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way"></a>Increase focus the Pomodoro Way<a class="hash-link" href="#increase-focus-the-pomodoro-way" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you are working on tasks, a good way to split the time into chunks is to use the Pomodoro technique. Even if the task itself seems to require variable amounts of time to complete, the time period of 25 minutes that you allocate for a Pomodoro is enough to focus on the task at hand without any distractions and motivate yourself to pull through, especially if the task is arduous. Another important aspect of using the Pomodoro technique is that you can schedule in the mental breaks that you need in order for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it takes in all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode, where it can make the underlying connections between the different pieces of information to construct a higher level understanding or a mental model of the concepts involved.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="get-enough-sleep"></a>Get enough sleep<a class="hash-link" href="#get-enough-sleep" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Make sure to get enough sleep when you are studying or working. If you feel that you can subsist on lesser sleep, then by all means stick to your own schedule. However, if you find yourself falling asleep in the middle of the day, you can stick to the guideline of 7-8 hours of sleep. That said, afternoon naps can actually be beneficial for learning, so you can take power naps and sleep less during the night.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="seperate-editing-from-writing"></a>Seperate editing from writing<a class="hash-link" href="#seperate-editing-from-writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you are working on your report or essay, separate your editing work from your writing. This is because editing employs the focussed mode while writing itself requires your brain to switch to the diffuse mode.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="make-your-learning-active"></a>Make your learning active<a class="hash-link" href="#make-your-learning-active" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take steps to make sure your learning is active, not passive. Practice active recall by taking a step back from the source material and try to remember the salient points that it covers. Take notes of what you have learned during the course and review them on the same day. Analyse the content of the chapter beforehand so that you have a better idea of what it is trying to cover before diving into the detail.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="simulate-the-exam-conditions"></a>Simulate the exam conditions<a class="hash-link" href="#simulate-the-exam-conditions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Take practice tests that simulate the kind of questions that are likely to appear on the final exam and do so under the right exam conditions. Allocate the same amount of time that will be required to complete the final exam. Use the Hard Start technique when you start to approach the exam questions: go for the hardest questions, which are usualy the ones with the most weightage, stop when you get stuck on those and then go back to solve the easier problems so that your brain in the diffuse mode can continue to work on the harder problem in the background.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy"></a>Exercise regularly and eat healthy<a class="hash-link" href="#exercise-regularly-and-eat-healthy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>It is important to exercise and follow the proper diet regime. This is because a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for learning new information. The recommended amount of exercise is 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week which amounts to a total of 150 minutes a week. You can do HIIT exercises at home if you cannot go to the gym or do not have the time to go somewhere outside for a walk and jog.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="follow-the-instructions"></a>Follow the instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#follow-the-instructions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Read exam questions and instructions carefully. The instructions may indicate adjustments you need to make in your exam strategy. For example, if the instructions show that there are negative marks for wrong answers, then you would have to be more careful when you do guesswork.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="interleave-your-studies"></a>Interleave your studies<a class="hash-link" href="#interleave-your-studies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Interleave your studies by mixing problems that you work on from differenet topics instead of going through the topics sequentially. This is where you have to depart from the teaching methods used by teachers and textbooks because that;s how you can draw connections between different topics to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter for the test</p><p>Most, if not all, of these methods have been tailored specifically for students at different levels of schooling, but they are applicable to learners of all ages. Learning is an ongoing process and the journey can be made easier with the right learning skills in your toolbox. It feels like this book is a manual for better understanding how the brain works.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Learn Like a Pro - A Book Review" href="/blog/learn-like-a-pro-a-book-review"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
