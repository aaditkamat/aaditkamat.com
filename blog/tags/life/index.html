That&#x27;s ok, because at the stage of life they are in, they have insufficient data to make the decision.</p><p>There are exceptions: the so called &quot;prodigies&quot;. <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.47.1.273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyschology Professor Anders Ericsson&#x27;s study</a> provides good grounds to study expert performance:</p><blockquote><p>The highest levels of human performance in different domains can only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate practice activities.</p></blockquote><p>Hence, these prodigies are likely not born with innate talent: they are imbued with it because they have put in prodigious amounts of work during the early stages of childhood.</p><p>There are usually two reasons for this kind of early success:
1) &quot;Nurture&quot;: Kids are brought up in an environment in which they end up dedicating that amount of time to practice and refine skills in a particular domain</p><p>2) &quot;Nature&quot;: The child just chances upon something that catches his fancy. It is unlikely to an isolated occurence but a chain of serendipitous events that lead to the spark(s). Even so, the child still has to struggle with mastery: it&#x27;s a violation of the fundamental laws of human cognition to assume that the child picks up the skills with less effort just because he/she can learn things fast</p><p>That&#x27;s why I say, you have to let kids explore their interests. Of course, as a good parent, you have to also make sure that they are putting in the hard work to build up a certain level of mastery. If you force them to pick something else to specialize in, they are likely to have some regret: &quot;what if, instead, I had pursued something I was truly interested in&quot;? </p><p>Trevor Noah has expressed this sentiment beautifully in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1633442048&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Born A Crime&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection.

Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIf only‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder what would have‚Ä¶‚Äù You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days</p></blockquote><p>When kids don&#x27;t have any idea, any domain they choose to specialize is good because the only things stopping the kid are hard work and determination. It&#x27;s unlikely that the kids know beforehand where their true interest lies.</p><p>Most children may remember rolling their eyes as their parents lecture them about the importance of hard work. That&#x27;s because they have little idea for hard work looks like. They do not have the foresight (or hindsight if you look at it from the parent&#x27;s perspective) to see where the hard work will lead them. It is also very hard for parents to communicate the importance of hard work without coming off as dogmatic.</p><p>In the end, I believe it&#x27;s a mix of hard work, inclination (both of which are interrelated) and a mix of circumstances that governs the direction that life of the child will take.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/career">career</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Encouraging kids to pursue their interests" href="/blog/encouraging-kids-to-pursue-their-interests"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness">Creativity leads to happiness</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 30, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In my <a href="/blog/happiness-is-success">previous blog post</a>, I had discussed about how happiness is a measure of success. </p><p>But one might ask, how do you attain happiness? </p><p>This is one of the questions that humans have posed for ages. It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I&#x27;ll just share what I think.</p><p>My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. </p><p>One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. </p><p>Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. </p><p>Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. </p><p>As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other&#x27;s ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.</p><p>A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;A Man&#x27;s Search For Meaning&quot;</a> is in order here: &quot;In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.&quot; </p><p>Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it&#x27;s this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Creativity leads to happiness" href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/happiness-is-success">Happiness is success</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 23, 2021 ¬∑ 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>What our parents have taught us from a young is mostly true. Hard work, determination
and focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn
to become successful.</p><p>However, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions
our parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.
There is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing
goals and goals are largely individualistic.</p><p>It&#x27;s not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it&#x27;s important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make.
This reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even
having an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.</p><p>Just like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.</p><p>As you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. </p><p>Of course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.</p><p>They act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don&#x27;t get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. </p><p>With the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The only panacea to this information overload is to create</a>. Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.</p><p>When you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.</p><p>This is what I believe true success looks like.</p><blockquote><p>Inspired by reading a Kindle sample of &quot;Think Like A Monk&quot; by Jay Shetty</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Happiness is success" href="/blog/happiness-is-success"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity">Embrace the messiness of creativity</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">September 19, 2021 ¬∑ 6 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>We often like to look at the end result and awe at the mastery involved in creating that result. However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann&#x27;s Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I&#x27;m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to &quot;unlock&quot; your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learning"></a>Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As I&#x27;ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of &quot;connecting the dots&quot; in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="conversing"></a>Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can&#x27;t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that&#x27;s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="coding"></a>Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn&#x27;t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn&#x27;t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn&#x27;t fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That&#x27;s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren&#x27;t going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exercising"></a>Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="writing"></a>Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of. This involves getting comfortable with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process of rewriting</a></p><p>Even that may not be sufficient because you often incorporate feedback from others that become a part of your work. That&#x27;s a part of the process because no person is an island in themselves.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="summary"></a>Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All the messiness behind creativity, by no means, discounts the importance of focus. We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the &quot;focussed mode&quot; of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the &quot;diffused mode&quot; and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It&#x27;s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don&#x27;t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Embrace the messiness of creativity" href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-butterfly-effect">The butterfly effect</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 17, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Even as I post this, I wonder: I may not make much of an impact as an individual who is posting this, no matter how many notes I create, but people like me who use these platforms in large numbers will eventually put a strain on the systems underlying these platforms. </p><p>That&#x27;s why most tech companies have teams managing load balancing on their servers and perform stress testing to ensure the reliability of the systems.

Such effects have probably panned out on a bigger scale to phenomena such as climate change that can be described as hyperobjects, events spanning across a large amount of space and time that are a complex intermingling of many different interactions. </p><p>We have to be kind to ourselves as a species because we are not good at predicting the future. That&#x27;s just not the way we are engineered. With time, we have evolved to set long term goals and work towards them, but we&#x27;ve to spend most of the time looking out for what lies ahead of us in the immediate future.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The butterfly effect" href="/blog/the-butterfly-effect"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/is-college-essential-for-success">Is college essential for success?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 8, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The learning experience in college experience is very different from the learning experience in schools. You have more flexibility to choose the courses related to your major as long as you meet the degree requirements. You not only learn hard skills related to your discipline, but also develop soft skills that are critical for success not only within college but also later on in life.
Colleges offer many avenues for students to discover their interests and follow career paths that align with those interests. One of the primary activities that colleges are renowned for is research. That is why, one of the major factors that decide the ranking of a college is research output. If your goal is to pursue a career in academia, then college is the best path to achieve that goal. </p><p>You can also pursue entrepreneurship when you are in college. One of the ways to do so is to take up a minor in entrepreneurship. If that does not fit your schedule, you may want to add some entrepreneurship classes to your schedule. The best way to get into entrepreneurship, however, is to work on your own project and secure funding to turn your idea into a startup. </p><p>At the same time, there is some merit to the idea that college is not an absolute prerequisite for career success. There are fields where there are ample opportunities to self learn and you can in fact thrive better if you are an autodidactic learner. Even then, going to college is still not a waste of your time and resources. You never know when the knowledge you gain through your courses proves to be useful in your career.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Is college essential for success?" href="/blog/is-college-essential-for-success"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world">Parenting in the digital world</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 7, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this digital age, children are exposed to a vast amount of information through the internet. On one hand, children can be better informed about the current affairs and issues in the modern world. On the other, they are also faced with a lot of distractions that shift away their focus from the things that are most important for them.</p><p>Parenting has always been challenging. However, parents now have the added responsibility of warding off these distractions. The dramatic changes introduced by technological interventions have widened the generational gap between parents and their kids, compounding matters even further. As children have been imbibed with a greater sense of independence, they have started to critically question their parent&#x27;s advice instead of taking it as the gospel.</p><p>Hence, it is important for parents to change their attitudes as well as their approaches to parenting. They can no longer hope to achieve parenting success through top down instructional methods. Rather, they have to learn to put on critical thinking hats themselves. They need to explain their decisions in a rational manner, by delineating the thought processes behind those decisions. They should expect to be challenged about their line of reasoning. This is important because it allows them to take a step back and reflect on the flaws in the reasoning.</p><p>Parents can and should learn from children as children do from them. Including kids in the decision making gives them more autonomy. This in turn enables parents to be better guides in the journey that they undertake with their children.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Parenting in the digital world" href="/blog/parenting-in-the-digital-world"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/importance-of-education">Importance of Education</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 4, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Education equips individuals with basic literacy skills like reading and writing. While the primary aim of modern education is to help students develop a set of core competencies or &quot;hard skills&quot;, it also helps them furnish soft skills like communication and teamwork that are becoming more and more critical in the workplace.</p><p>The value of education is intrinsic: you simply cannot judge the value of education by looking at the return of investment. This is because, you cannot pre-emptively determine how your learning in prior years will become relevant later on in life.</p><p>Education enhances the quality of your mind. Having a well-developed mind is essential for developing the cognitive abilities needed to make sense of the vast array of information we are exposed to in the current times.</p><p>Many of the problems in the current education systems around the world arise due to an over emphasis on testing and grades. Teachers are obligated to complete the topics within the curriculum on time. To ensure that students are learning at the right pace, they have to assign homework. Sometimes, the amount of homework assigned becomes too much and this leaves the student less time to engage with other activities that are important for their development. It is important to re-evaluate current education models so that we can achieve a right balance and make education more holistic.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Importance of Education" href="/blog/importance-of-education"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/sports-exemplifies-the-human-spirit">Sports exemplifies the human spirit</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 30, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I generally don&#x27;t watch that much sports, but it&#x27;s the Olympics season so I wanted to catch some of the action. As I switch on the channel broadcasting the Olympics only after work ends at 7 pm, I was only able to watch the swimming event.</p><p>It was amazing to see how the athletes, so lithe and graceful in their movements, rugged in physique, competing down to the wire.</p><p>As a Singaporean, I was looking forward to the 100m and 200m Butterfly heats where the participants from Singapore, Zheng Wen Quah and Joseph Schooling were competing to qualify for the semi finals. A lot of hopes rested on the shoulders of Joseph Schooling in particular, who had broken the Olympic Record during his gold medal run in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>Unfortunately, both of them did not manage to qualify. To make matters worse, Joseph Schooling was the last one to finish the race amongst the participants in his section. The disappointment did not sink in until the next day as I read Rohit Brijnath&#x27;s article in the Straits TImes on Joseph&#x27;s showing.</p><p>To me, Olympics is a treat to watch not only because of the intensity of the competition but because I can see the principles of hard work and perservance so clearly demonstrated during the live event. This year&#x27;s event was especially challenging one thanks to COVID-19. Even if only a few would go on to qualify and only 3 would bag medals, it is a great accomplishment just to be able to compete at the Olympics. Being able to shrug off the defeat and move on is a testament to the indomitable human spirit as wins and losses are a part and parcel of sports.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/sports">sports</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Sports exemplifies the human spirit" href="/blog/sports-exemplifies-the-human-spirit"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift">The Power Of Music To Uplift</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 29, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack &amp; Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.</p><p>As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.</p><p>Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.</p><p>You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That&#x27;s where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.</p><p>To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The Power Of Music To Uplift" href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-state-of-happiness">The State of Happiness</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 28, 2021 ¬∑ 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It appears as though every human being on this planet ultimately seeks to be happy. As most of us will be aware through our personal experiences though, it is impossible to achieve everlasting happiness. Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.</p><p>It is hard to quantify happiness, since happiness is a state of the mind. Also, happiness is relative. You are likely to feel happier on days when your mood is uplifted or even normal as compared to days when you have gone through a rough patch.</p><p>There are different sources of happiness. Some find happiness in their work. Some find happiness through connecting with their loved ones. Others find happiness through gaining wealth and other materialistic possessions.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the happiest people are those that are the most wealthy. However, money can also be a source of stress. The rich are often unsure whether the friends they have are true friends or merely friends of their money. Studies measuring the happiness quotient also seem to indicate that happiness tends to increase with income levels but only uptil an inflection point, where the curve then tapers off.</p><p>In my opinion, the happiest people are the ones who are able to remain focussed on the present instead of worrying excessively about what the future holds or remaining stuck with the regrets of the past. They are able to manage their expectations realistically and maintain a healthy balance between their social and work lives.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The State of Happiness" href="/blog/the-state-of-happiness"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
