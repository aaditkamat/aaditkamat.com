As I switch on the channel broadcasting the Olympics only after work ends at 7 pm, I was only able to watch the swimming event.</p><p>It was amazing to see how the athletes, so lithe and graceful in their movements, rugged in physique, competing down to the wire.</p><p>As a Singaporean, I was looking forward to the 100m and 200m Butterfly heats where the participants from Singapore, Zheng Wen Quah and Joseph Schooling were competing to qualify for the semi finals. A lot of hopes rested on the shoulders of Joseph Schooling in particular, who had broken the Olympic Record during his gold medal run in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>Unfortunately, both of them did not manage to qualify. To make matters worse, Joseph Schooling was the last one to finish the race amongst the participants in his section. The disappointment did not sink in until the next day as I read Rohit Brijnath&#x27;s article in the Straits TImes on Joseph&#x27;s showing.</p><p>To me, Olympics is a treat to watch not only because of the intensity of the competition but because I can see the principles of hard work and perservance so clearly demonstrated during the live event. This year&#x27;s event was especially challenging one thanks to COVID-19. Even if only a few would go on to qualify and only 3 would bag medals, it is a great accomplishment just to be able to compete at the Olympics. Being able to shrug off the defeat and move on is a testament to the indomitable human spirit as wins and losses are a part and parcel of sports.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/sports">sports</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Sports exemplifies the human spirit" href="/blog/sports-exemplifies-the-human-spirit"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift">The Power Of Music To Uplift</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 29, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack &amp; Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.</p><p>As a result, you can see music being played in different places like in a shopping mall, in a supermarket or venues hosting events. Music paints any occasion with different strokes of color, making it more memorable.</p><p>Taking a break from work by listening to music rejuvenates the spirits. Music can become a distraction during work, but there are forms of music like jazz or classical music that provide a positive benefit by helping you power through longer periods of challenging work.</p><p>You can also learn better by attaching emotion to whatever it is you are learning. That&#x27;s where music can play an instrumental role, as music evokes emotions. That is why you may forget information important to you yet remember the lyrics of your favourite songs almost verbatim without much effort.</p><p>To avoid forking out a lot of money to purchase music from official sources, users of the internet in the early days often had to resort to downloading or streaming music from illegitimate sources, leading to copyright infringement issues. Thanks to companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google that have made their respective services available at competitive subscription prices, avid music listeners today can enjoy access to music produced by a variety of creators around the world.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The Power Of Music To Uplift" href="/blog/the-power-of-music-to-uplift"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/the-state-of-happiness">The State of Happiness</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 28, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It appears as though every human being on this planet ultimately seeks to be happy. As most of us will be aware through our personal experiences though, it is impossible to achieve everlasting happiness. Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.</p><p>It is hard to quantify happiness, since happiness is a state of the mind. Also, happiness is relative. You are likely to feel happier on days when your mood is uplifted or even normal as compared to days when you have gone through a rough patch.</p><p>There are different sources of happiness. Some find happiness in their work. Some find happiness through connecting with their loved ones. Others find happiness through gaining wealth and other materialistic possessions.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the happiest people are those that are the most wealthy. However, money can also be a source of stress. The rich are often unsure whether the friends they have are true friends or merely friends of their money. Studies measuring the happiness quotient also seem to indicate that happiness tends to increase with income levels but only uptil an inflection point, where the curve then tapers off.</p><p>In my opinion, the happiest people are the ones who are able to remain focussed on the present instead of worrying excessively about what the future holds or remaining stuck with the regrets of the past. They are able to manage their expectations realistically and maintain a healthy balance between their social and work lives.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The State of Happiness" href="/blog/the-state-of-happiness"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
