Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Early this morning, I attended a talk given by Nadia Zhuk, a software engineer at <a href="http://intercom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercom</a> and mentor at <a href="https://meetamentor.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet a Mentor</a>, on the <a href="https://www.codementor.io/events/how-working-as-a-programmer-helped-me-write-a-book-e1gbc1hk2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codementor Events</a> platform. This talk was geared not just toward other software developers but also toward those looking to break into tech. In this talk, Nadia shared her experience with translating lessons learned from coding into her writing with her audience. </p><p>Before working at companies like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk</a> and Intercom as a software engineer, Nadia was a news reporter and a copywriter. This work led her to different places, from Belarus to Israel to Ireland and London, where she now lives. </p><h1>Takeaways</h1><p>These are my takeaways from the talk:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure">Lesson #1: Learn to embrace failure<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had a tough time preparing for her coding interviews at Zendesk. She had barely picked up HTML after struggling with it and even giving up a couple of times. She felt that her skills were up to the mark, even though she had some development experience before applying to Zendesk. Even after cracking the interviews, she felt that collaborating with senior developers in the team who were much more skilled would be pretty daunting. </p><p>However, Nadia slowly learned to bite the bullet and embrace failure. Since her work at companies like Zendesk and Intercom needed to be of a high standard, Nadia realized that she had to take all the feedback on her work in her stride. </p><p>This is one of the first lessons she applied to her writing: she had to be comfortable with the negative criticisms she received for the first draft of her book. She found it difficult to do so because her editor told her that the draft felt incoherent and structured more like a series of long blog posts rather than a novel. It lacked a proper narrative flow. </p><p>Nadia shared that while she was gracious enough in accepting failure initially, she learned a lot from her editor&#x27;s feedback for the first draft that she could apply to her other drafts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-2-learn-from-the-best">Lesson #2: Learn from the best<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-2-learn-from-the-best" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another major lesson that she applied from her coding experience was to learn from the best. When she first started developing in Ruby, she referred to books written by some of the most widely known and respected engineers in the Ruby community. Even though their writings sometimes went over her head, she did not give up and instead used her inability to grasp concepts as opportunities to slowly but surely improve her craft. </p><p>Before drafting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56082981-crossing-the-rubycon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her book</a>, Nadia had read books written by great authors such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen King</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Zinsser</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2417381.The_Collected_Oscar_Wilde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Wilde</a>, amongst others, who dispensed some valuable lessons on writing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out">Lesson #3: Get yourself unstuck by talking it out<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Programming can be a rather tedious affair. You have to often spend a significant amount of time discovering bugs in your code, sometimes even more than writing all that code in the first place. When developers get frustrated working on their programs, they often resort to a technique colloquially known as <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;talking to the rubber duck.&quot;</a> This means that developers review their code in greater detail and talk through it during the review. Some developers use a rubber duck as a persona to communicate their thoughts verbally, but catching hold of another developer works just fine. </p><p>Writing, similarly, is nefariously hard and can feel even more lonely as the lone writer does most of the heavy lifting, at least during the drafting process. Talking through the writing helps the writer combat the loneliness that accompanies the writing process and get the ball rolling when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writer&#x27;s block</a> impedes progress.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro">Lesson #4: Learn to &quot;be a pro&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another invaluable lesson Nadia learned is to &quot;be a pro.&quot; This sounds rather generic, but Nadia meant to say that she learned to respect her side projects, in this case, the writing project, as she would her day-to-day work. </p><p>Initially, she would leave most of her writing work for the weekends and could not find the discipline to stick to a schedule. She realized soon enough, however, that she would not be able to finish her writing on time this way. Hence, she started to write on other days of the week and even during vacations. </p><p>Each day she wrote, she stuck to the task of writing until she was sure that she had nothing more to write that day. Being consistent and showing up counts more than talent most of the time, and this, Nadia feels, can be used to accomplish many goals that initially seem quite daunting. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-5-get-feedback-early">Lesson #5: Get feedback early<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-5-get-feedback-early" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had shown her first draft to the editor only after two months of grokking through it. In retrospect, she regrets delaying the process of getting feedback from her editor as she had to rewrite significant chunks during her second draft. That is why she feels that it is essential to get feedback as early as possible and get the book&#x27;s overall structure outlined and approved before diving into the actual writing. </p><p>In a way, it&#x27;s helpful to approach writing with an <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agile</a> mindset, shipping out the work fast and iterating several times based on the feedback, just like you would when you ship software by following agile processes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The primary lesson Nadia wished to impart through this talk was that she could successfully transition into her developer role because she reviewed the skills from her previous roles and tried to find some overlap with the skills required for her new roles. When she could not find that overlap, she approached the process of skill building like a craftsman: picking up things from scratch, refining her skills with inputs from the best, and learning to embrace the failures. </p><h1>Q &amp; A</h1><p>During the Q &amp; A section, the first question I asked Nadia was about her writing tools. She replied that she had not invested in any fancy writing software. Instead, she chose to stick to <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a>, where she could get comments from her editor. In addition to Google Docs, she used <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProWritingAid</a> for writing suggestions beyond the simple grammatical and spelling checks carried out on Google Docs.</p><p>I also asked her about her blogging experience. While she said that she did not blog much before becoming an author and only does so occasionally even now, she wrote a lot when she studied journalism and learned a good bit about writing as a copy editor. Even though she learned about writing in Russian, she was able to use her understanding of the mechanics of writing in one language to guide her writing in another language, English.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/writing">writing</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coding">coding</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Lessons from a Codementor Events talk" href="/blog/lessons-from-a-codementor-events-talk"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/how-you-can-approach-a-leetcode-problem">How You Can Approach a LeetCode Problem</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 16, 2020</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I’m by no means an expert at Leetcoding. Dynamic Programming problems in particular trip me up a lot. Nevertheless, I thought that I’d give it a try and share the way I go about solving a problem on LeetCode, especially if I’m not on a time crunch.</p><p>Truth be told, I’m not a big fan of the <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/366193/losing-motivation/688434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode grind</a>. This kind of an approach seems very similar to that required for solving Competitive Programming problems, where you are given the constraints on the inputs and outputs and you try to go for the most optimal solution that is not only efficient in terms of the order of time and space complexity i.e. the complexity of the solution expressed in the Big-O notation, but in terms of the limits imposed by the platform.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iXpPNZ0mu44gyJtomvg0lA.png" alt="Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem statement with examples for a sample LeetCode problem </figcaption></figure><p>Instead, I like to think of a LeetCode problem as it would more or less appear in an interview. Yes, you don’t have an interviewer with you to help clarify your doubts, but you can take note of them before you go ahead with designing a solution. It’s even better if you use LeetCode problems as you conduct mock interviews with your friends, since your friend can play the role of an interviewer. Start by looking through the problem statement and examples, then <b>write down your assumptions.</b></p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*S2BtsRUSVK1b7ZQsEuAjXw.png" alt="Problem constraints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Problem constraints </figcaption></figure><p>You should ideally do this even <b>before you look at the problem constraints</b>. This is because interviewers tend to pose the interview problem with slight ambiguity in order to give candidates the opportunity to ask for additional clarification. As a result, they would not generally start by specifying the problem constraints.</p><p>Once you have written down your assumptions about the problem, go ahead and check with the constraints of the problems to see if those assumptions are met. If they do, then that’s great. Otherwise, you may get additional insight about the kind of edge cases that you may have missed out on.</p><p>Once you have clarified your doubts and checked your assumptions, <b>try to come up with a brute force solution and not search for the most optimal solution at first</b>. For easy problems, this will usually work. However, even for the harder problems, coming up with something that at least works is better than nothing. Also, this brute force solution gives you an opportunity to discuss why this solution is inefficient and may serve as a guide to a better solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*P0Nhu_AfJ8fbeSSUDbIU2g.png" alt="Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Related Topics, Similar Questions and Hints </figcaption></figure><p>The next step now is to optimize your brute force solution. This is often done with the help of some data structures or algorithmic patterns. If you are stuck at this stage, you can look at the Related Topics and Hints (if available) sections of the problem. This is sort of the equivalent of asking an interviewer for a hint. From what I know, most interviewers are ok with giving hints as long as you have explained your approach thus far and where you are stuck. If your interviewers are nice enough, they may be willing to help you out but don’t go about solving a problem with that assumption.</p><p>Hopefully, looking at those sections has given you a fair idea for an optimized solution. Once you have done that, take out your whiteboard (or if you are like me and don’t have a whiteboard, use pen and paper instead) and go about writing your solution over there. Trust me, the experience of “whiteboard coding” is much different from using an editor, not only because you miss out on the syntax highlighting and code completion, but also the core editing features such as copy and paste.</p><p>Once you have done that, run your solution through a couple of cases, which should be a mix of the given examples (for sanity check) and some other cases, including edge cases, that you have identified when you came up with the assumptions. Make sure you do this manually and not using the LeetCode console at first. This allows you to spot the bugs in your code and address the problems in your solution. This also saves you from having to edit your solution multiple times.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Rf4ufh6V7-3MQ0ozLH1NaA.png" alt="A solution with time and space complexity specified" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> A solution with time and space complexity specified </figcaption></figure><p>Once you are confident that your code works and is efficient to the best of your knowledge, write down the time and space complexity for your proposed solution. This way, you have a clear metric to demonstrate how the current solution is better than your previous solution and also discuss the tradeoffs should you have any alternate approaches.</p><p>Now that you have tried everything you possibly could to get to the best solution, it’s time to test your code with the cases that you have come up with. LeetCode premium users can make use of the debugger, but in my opinion, it’s best to stick to the console. This is because it is unlikely that you would be allowed to use a debugger for a real interview question. If you get an error for a particular case then try to go through solution again manually. If that still does not help you, you have no choice but to use logging techniques to debug your solution.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Discussion section for the sample problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center"> Discussion section for the sample problem </figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6LHBCNE3sHtv1RSfF3ICMw.png" alt="Official solution for another problem" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption align="center">Official solution for another problem</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, after all this hard work, if all your test cases have passed, just go ahead and submit your solution! If the solution has been accepted, well done. You can go ahead and post your solution in the Discuss section. You can also check out what others have posted or even have a look at the official solutions if they have been provided. Otherwise, you can see what test case has failed and address the problem(s) in your solution.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to work on the problem again from scratch. Chances are that you would have a fresh approach to look at the problem and that might do the trick! It’s important to remember that you learn from incorrect solutions as much (if not more) as you learn from the correct solutions.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coding">coding</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interviews">interviews</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about How You Can Approach a LeetCode Problem" href="/blog/how-you-can-approach-a-leetcode-problem"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
