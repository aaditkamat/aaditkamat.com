I enjoyed watching it, but I could not appreciate the inherently philosophical nature of the movie. A close friend of mine who had watched it recently suggested that I rewatch it as he believed that I would be able to glean new insights from the film. And indeed, I could not help but marvel at its beauty. It feels as though each line from the film has some nugget of wisdom hidden in it. That&#x27;s why I thought that I would write up a blog post sharing some of my takeaways from the film.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-choice"></a>About choice<a class="hash-link" href="#about-choice" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>At a surface level, it&#x27;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeovers_in_popular_culture#1950s_and_earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dystopian science fiction film that discusses the existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence</a>. However, at a deeper level, the movie talks about choice: the role humans can play in shaping their destinies.</p><p>One of the scenes that immediately pops up to the mind is the choice between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill that Neo has to make if he wants to truly understand the nature of the Matrix. However, there are several other small or big choices that Neo has to make: choosing to follow Trinity&#x27;s instructions or searching for Morpheus on his own, choosing to believe that he is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; or not, choosing to risk his life to save Morpheus&#x27;s life. </p><p>The freedom of choice is juxtaposed with the role of destiny. As Neo says to Morpheus, he does not believe in fate because that means that he does not have control over his life. This seems to apply pretty well to the world of the Matrix because it is meant to be deterministic but may not apply to the &quot;real world&quot;. However, it highlights the human tendency to be proactive, as opposed to reactive, and try to expand their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/980363-proactive-people-focus-their-efforts-in-the-circle-of-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circle of influence</a>.</p><p>One of the characters, who goes by the alias &quot;Mouse&quot;, has programmed a woman in a red dress to be sent out into the Matrix. She serves as a distraction, literally a red herring (hence the color red). The way I interpreted it, it seemed like a message that humans who choose to lead a focused life have to cull a lot of distractions along the way to reach their goal(s). This is especially true in this digital age where such distractions abound.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-buddhism"></a>About Buddhism<a class="hash-link" href="#about-buddhism" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Central to religions like Buddhism is the practice of meditation. There are several kinds of meditation exercises, but one of the most basic ones involves focussing intently on your breath. That&#x27;s because it is a sure way of grounding you in the present moment. When Neo resists as he learns the truth about the Matrix and goes into a spiral, Morpheus asks him to breathe to stay calm. This is almost certainly a reference to the role of breath in staying grounded. It&#x27;s also not a coincidence that Morpheus seems to spout a lot of Buddhist koan-like statements such as this one:</p><blockquote><p>Neo: I thought it wasn&#x27;t real
Morpheus: Your mind makes it real
Neo: If you&#x27;re killed in the matrix, you die here?
Morpheus: The body cannot live without the mind </p></blockquote><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-discovery"></a>About discovery<a class="hash-link" href="#about-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When Trinity first meets Neo she says:</p><blockquote><p>It&#x27;s the question that drives us, Neo...The answer is out there looking for you and it will find you if you want it to</p></blockquote><p>This drives home the point about life being a process of search and discovery. Few of the truths we seek are objective, except perhaps those that we have stipulated and agreed upon as laws.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-belief"></a>About belief<a class="hash-link" href="#about-belief" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Neo spends a lot of the time believing that he is not the &quot;chosen One&quot;. However, when he&#x27;s forced to choose between his life and Morpheus&#x27;s life, he becomes much more decisive. He takes the reins of freeing Morpheus into his own hands. Even though he&#x27;s faced by agents who are much stronger and faster than he is, Neo is able to free his mind from fear and other delusions to unlock his true potential. In doing so, he sees the Matrix as it truly is: computer code processing data in a mainframe. He is, therefore, able to thwart the attempts made by the Matrix to control him.</p><p>The sparring session between Morpheus and neo underscores the importance of belief even further:</p><blockquote><p>Morpheus: How did I beat you?
Neo: You... you&#x27;re too fast.
Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that&#x27;s air you&#x27;re breathing now?</p></blockquote><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-reality"></a>About reality<a class="hash-link" href="#about-reality" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As Morpheus is explaining the nature of the Matrix, he questions Neo:</p><blockquote><p>What is real? How do you define &#x27;real&#x27;? If you&#x27;re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then &#x27;real&#x27; is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p></blockquote><p>This alludes to that our mind is a VR simulator in itself: we form perceptions about the world in front of us, based on what are actually electrical sensory inputs.</p><p>Thinking about the &quot;real world&quot; in this light, it doesn&#x27;t seem absurd that Cerebro should wish to betray the other crew members and return to the Matrix. Is the outside world any less real than the world of the Matrix? It becomes a matter of perspective because you can hack your psychology to &quot;Blue Pill&quot; it away.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="about-love"></a>About Love<a class="hash-link" href="#about-love" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>During Neo&#x27;s first meeting with the Oracle, she points to a banner and says:</p><blockquote><p>Do you know what means? It&#x27;s Latin. It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.</p></blockquote><p>True love, just like success and happiness, is an aspiration that is hard to achieve. The more you go out of the way to find &quot;true love&quot;, the more it seems to elude you. The best you can do is share your feelings with someone whom you truly find special. If you are lucky, you may find love on your first try. Often though, it takes trial and tribulations, rejections after rejections, before you find love. </p><p>In the end, you have to go with your gut because you can&#x27;t decode the inner workings of your mind.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/movies">movies</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about My thoughts on the Matrix" href="/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-matrix"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
