I could barely sleep the night before, as I wondered what results my efforts had accomplished. In my mind, the results were the entry ticket to a prestigious college – either here in Singapore or in the US. All while I was trying to get over the culture shock of being a recruit at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI) and completing the Basic Rescue Training as part of my National Service obligations.</p><p>To all the high school students awaiting for their results pensively, I wish to convey this: examinations are a part and parcel of student life. Use them as tools to gauge your grasp of concepts, not as tools to judge your self-worth.</p><p>I know that this is easier said than done, but believe me, just acknowledging this to yourself from time to time helps make the process easier. My hope is that this journal entry will be useful to you in getting over that anxiety. To all the other readers out there, if you are looking for some inspiration to overcome your hurdles, you are welcome to read this piece as well.</p><p>So how did I get into this situation? Let me give you all some context to understand my predicament. I was of an academic bent back in my high school years. Instead of participating in any kind of sports or recreational activities, I spent most of my time taking down notes, revising my study material and poring through the textbooks for insights.</p><p>As I performed well in my examinations and stayed on top of my homework, I was in the good books of my teachers. However, missing out on other aspects of the educational experience meant that it was not holistic enough. I was not taking good care of my health, my social life was virtually non-existent and I had no practical knowledge to supplement my theoretical knowledge from academic material.</p><p>I realized how woefully inadept I was at “roughing it out” when I enlisted into NSTI as a recruit. Not only was I burst out of the social bubble of Indians that I was interacting with during my time at the Global Indian International School, I was also no longer the stellar student. Instead, I was fledgling, as a nondescript recruit trying to complete my basic tasks and responsibilities. I was not particularly good at collaborating with fellow recruits who stayed in the same bunk and I kept getting reprimanded by my instructors when I failed to follow simple instructions.</p><p>Then came the month before the finals. While I had spent more than a year preparing for these, it was this final month where I had to step it up, to make my efforts count. Unlike the previous years, where the final scores were a cumulative of the scores obtained in different examinations with assigned weightages, the pressure I felt was different this time, because only the scores from these finals would be factored in during the admission process.</p><p>As far as I can remember, I spent most of my waking hours studying. I felt guilty whenever I felt that I was taking unnecessary breaks. My exercise time dwindled even further and there were times when I felt burnt out. To top it all, I did not perform as well in my practice tests and that only increased my anxiety about my performance.</p><p>It took an unanticipated outburst at my parents for me to realize that I had to slow down a little, take it easy. I told myself that I was not going to succeed by thinking too much about the final destination, but by focussing on the process . This meant setting incremental goals – getting a better score with each subsequent practice test, for example – and pushing the limits, slowly but surely.</p><p>Most importantly, I had let go of my own exalted aspirations and my parent’s expectations, so that I could focus on those incremental goals. Thankfully, my parents were quite supportive. They encouraged me to give my best, but also “hit the reset button” when things felt too overwhelming. This gave me the strength to plough through.</p><p>Well, I passed the examinations with flying colours. I stood 3rd in the school and surpassed my expectations. Most importantly, I felt a sense of relief surge through me as I got to know about my results. The circumstances around the announcement of my results were rather unexpected: one of the instructors took me aside after the class to tell me that I should call my mom, as she was the one who had informed him that she wished to share some important news with me. Generally, we were not allowed to use mobile phones over the course of the training during the day, but my instructor was kind enough to make an exception on this occasion.</p><p>Thanks to my excellent results, I was admitted into the National University of Singapore (NUS) to pursue a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. This was a dream come true!</p><p>However, once I had matriculated, I realized that the ballgame was different. Focussing on academics was one thing, but it was equally important to think about a career post-graduation and gain work experience through internships.</p><p>Landing an internship came with its own set of challenges, especially if as a freshman or sophomore with little prior experience. I had to build a portfolio, and I realized that it would be better to work on projects outside those that are part of curriculum.</p><p>Apart from school work and internships, I found more opportunities to network as I was part of a wider circle. True, a lot of my friends in NUS were Indians as well, but I met many more from different backgrounds, having a diverse set of experiences, just like I had during my time at NSTI.</p><p>This was also the time that I was exposed to communities, online and offline. I had to learn to manage my time better so that I could attend to all these competing interests, without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>Even on an academic front, studying the way I used to in high school wasn’t going to cut it. I had to adapt to the continual modes of assessment, that varied based on the course. Consistency and effective study strategies were more important than the actual time spent studying.</p><p>College made me realize how my perspective about life was circumscribed and how I could look towards the horizon for pushing my limits. I hope to hold on to this attitude of curiosity and open-mindedness as I have embarked on a new journey through my career post-graduation.</p><p>This Steve Jobs quote inspires me a lot: “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you, and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/advice-to-my-former-self">What you should know as an undergraduate student - advice to my former self</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 9, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

These are the four things that I wish I had known as an undergraduate student back in college.</p><p>First, I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten into the rat race to achieve stellar grades or bag prestigious internships at the top companies, just out of peer pressure. As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I&#x27;d instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they&#x27;d likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.</p><p>Second, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.</p><p>Third, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.</p><p>Last, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual&#x27;s perspective. People will always have some regrets when they reflect back upon their college days. So take this advice with a pinch of salt and enjoy the college journey while you can!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/my-journey-to-becoming-a-developer">My journey to becoming a developer</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 4, 2021</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn’t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn’t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I’d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor’s and Master’s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn’t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn’t need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I’d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the “sink or swim” methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren’t running an “Apple Genius Bar” service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven’t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends.
