These are the four things that I wish I had known as an undergraduate student back in college.</p><p>First, I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten into the rat race to achieve stellar grades or bag prestigious internships at the top companies, just out of peer pressure. As the definition of success varies from individual to individual, it does not make too much sense to focus exclusively on these goals. I&#x27;d instead advise students to spend the extra time they get from attending classes to carry out personal development activities, especially those that they&#x27;d likely not get the time to work on once they start a full-time job.</p><p>Second, think long term. It is important to develop hobbies outside of work that you can derive a sense of purpose from or find enjoyment in, so that you can keep yourself buoyed up when the going gets tough in your full-time job.</p><p>Third, form meaningful relationships with your professors by connecting with them after classes. This will help you in the long run, as the professor is likely to refer you to opportunities that will benefit you from a career perspective or within the college to develop skills.</p><p>Last, but not the least, all advice given to others is from that individual&#x27;s perspective. People will always have some regrets when they reflect back upon their college days. So take this advice with a pinch of salt and enjoy the college journey while you can!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about What you should know as an undergraduate student - advice to my former self" href="/blog/advice-to-my-former-self"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_Ikge" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/my-journey-to-becoming-a-developer">My journey to becoming a developer</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_SAv4 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 4, 2021</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_sTYa"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I first started coding in 11th Standard when I took up a course on Computer Science, at the age of 16. I had learnt about HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript back when I was in 9th and 10th, but I hadn’t used it to create a website beyond the project that was assigned in the classroom, so that knowledge was rusty. </p><p>Reflecting back on the experience in high school, I realise that I was more keen on learning other STEM subjects like Physics and Maths, so I didn’t spend much time learning about CS concepts beyond the classroom or researching about software in general. I’d also like to think that I had to spend a lot of time catching up with concepts taught at high school as it was a big jump from 10th to 11th.</p><p>After giving my board exams in 12th, I was required to enlist in SCDF on May 2015 as part of my National Service (NS) obligations. I had secured 96% in my board exams, which was good enough to secure an admission at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </p><p>I had initially applied for a Bachelor of Engineering degree program in Electrical Engineering as I wanted to continue learning physics at a higher level and apply concepts I had learnt in Electrodynamics and Mechanics classes back at high school to solve real Engineering problems. </p><p>Admittedly, my greatest source of inspiration was my dad, who had studied the same subject in college for his Bachelor’s and Master’s. However I had a change of mind after my discussion with my dad when I had passed out of recruit phase and was well settled into my new role as an Admin assistant at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI). Given my stellar results in the Computer Science subject and the rising demand for Computing professionals, my dad encouraged me to think of pursuing Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. </p><p>The admission criteria for getting into the School of Computing was more stringent as compared to the one to get into the Faculty of Engineering, but he said that it was worth a shot if I was truly interested. As I reconsidered my decision to apply to the Electrical Engineering course, I realised that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to go into Engineering of my own accord or because my other peers were applying for Engineering courses as well. </p><p>I didn’t know how Computer Science would turn out, but I decided to try something new and take the gamble of switching the course. To my fortune, I was accepted into the Computer Science course.</p><p>One of my regrets during my time in NS is that I did not try learning Computer Science concepts or practicing programming on my own over the weekends or after work. I assumed that I would learn more in depth in college anyways, so I didn’t need to spend the time doing that before college. </p><p>I’d like to clarify here that one can learn programming in college and still succeed in the Computer Science course. However, I would have had a better time during the CS1010X (Programming Methodology) course that I had taken as I was completing my NS, had I spent more time refreshing the concepts I had learnt back in high school.</p><p>Even though CS1010X was an introductory course, it was much more rigorous as compared to my high school course. The Professor who administered the course swore by the “sink or swim” methodology used to teach such courses there. </p><p>Of course, we were not left completely stranded and the Teaching Assistants as well as Prof himself were quite helpful when we ran into any issues. However, Prof made it amply clear that they weren’t running an “Apple Genius Bar” service to guide us through each small technical issue and we were expected to research solutions to our problems as far as we could. </p><p>This would turn out to be quite useful later on, during the course and after I had completed it, as every developer has to go through the journey of interpreting stack traces as they debug their programs, often on platforms like Stack Overflow. It takes a lot of time to get proficient at the art of debugging and it also depends on your experience with the particular programming language and project in question, but it helps you learn and ramp up quickly. This is something that I think most beginners might miss out in the beginning if they continue to follow along with tutorials or watch them passively without working on programming exercises and projects that employ these skills.</p><p>I haven’t yet mastered coding and I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out why I am running into a particular issue even now after I have completed my undergraduate Computer Science course, but I think that all of this is a part of a learning process that never truly ends. I started writing this post as I was reading through <a href="https://welearncode.com/25-tips-new-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Spittel’s tips to beginners</a>, as a way of reminding myself about how I started and what I can learn from my own journey that I can now apply to my work as a QA Engineer.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/college">college</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about My journey to becoming a developer" href="/blog/my-journey-to-becoming-a-developer"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
