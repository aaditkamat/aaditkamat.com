Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Early this morning, I attended a talk given by Nadia Zhuk, a software engineer at <a href="http://intercom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercom</a> and mentor at <a href="https://meetamentor.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet a Mentor</a>, on the <a href="https://www.codementor.io/events/how-working-as-a-programmer-helped-me-write-a-book-e1gbc1hk2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codementor Events</a> platform. This talk was geared not just toward other software developers but also toward those looking to break into tech. In this talk, Nadia shared her experience with translating lessons learned from coding into her writing with her audience. </p><p>Before working at companies like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk</a> and Intercom as a software engineer, Nadia was a news reporter and a copywriter. This work led her to different places, from Belarus to Israel to Ireland and London, where she now lives. </p><h1>Takeaways</h1><p>These are my takeaways from the talk:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure">Lesson #1: Learn to embrace failure<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-1-learn-to-embrace-failure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had a tough time preparing for her coding interviews at Zendesk. She had barely picked up HTML after struggling with it and even giving up a couple of times. She felt that her skills were up to the mark, even though she had some development experience before applying to Zendesk. Even after cracking the interviews, she felt that collaborating with senior developers in the team who were much more skilled would be pretty daunting. </p><p>However, Nadia slowly learned to bite the bullet and embrace failure. Since her work at companies like Zendesk and Intercom needed to be of a high standard, Nadia realized that she had to take all the feedback on her work in her stride. </p><p>This is one of the first lessons she applied to her writing: she had to be comfortable with the negative criticisms she received for the first draft of her book. She found it difficult to do so because her editor told her that the draft felt incoherent and structured more like a series of long blog posts rather than a novel. It lacked a proper narrative flow. </p><p>Nadia shared that while she was gracious enough in accepting failure initially, she learned a lot from her editor&#x27;s feedback for the first draft that she could apply to her other drafts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-2-learn-from-the-best">Lesson #2: Learn from the best<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-2-learn-from-the-best" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another major lesson that she applied from her coding experience was to learn from the best. When she first started developing in Ruby, she referred to books written by some of the most widely known and respected engineers in the Ruby community. Even though their writings sometimes went over her head, she did not give up and instead used her inability to grasp concepts as opportunities to slowly but surely improve her craft. </p><p>Before drafting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56082981-crossing-the-rubycon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her book</a>, Nadia had read books written by great authors such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen King</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Zinsser</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2417381.The_Collected_Oscar_Wilde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Wilde</a>, amongst others, who dispensed some valuable lessons on writing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out">Lesson #3: Get yourself unstuck by talking it out<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-3-get-yourself-unstuck-by-talking-it-out" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Programming can be a rather tedious affair. You have to often spend a significant amount of time discovering bugs in your code, sometimes even more than writing all that code in the first place. When developers get frustrated working on their programs, they often resort to a technique colloquially known as <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;talking to the rubber duck.&quot;</a> This means that developers review their code in greater detail and talk through it during the review. Some developers use a rubber duck as a persona to communicate their thoughts verbally, but catching hold of another developer works just fine. </p><p>Writing, similarly, is nefariously hard and can feel even more lonely as the lone writer does most of the heavy lifting, at least during the drafting process. Talking through the writing helps the writer combat the loneliness that accompanies the writing process and get the ball rolling when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writer&#x27;s block</a> impedes progress.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro">Lesson #4: Learn to &quot;be a pro&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-4-learn-to-be-a-pro" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Another invaluable lesson Nadia learned is to &quot;be a pro.&quot; This sounds rather generic, but Nadia meant to say that she learned to respect her side projects, in this case, the writing project, as she would her day-to-day work. </p><p>Initially, she would leave most of her writing work for the weekends and could not find the discipline to stick to a schedule. She realized soon enough, however, that she would not be able to finish her writing on time this way. Hence, she started to write on other days of the week and even during vacations. </p><p>Each day she wrote, she stuck to the task of writing until she was sure that she had nothing more to write that day. Being consistent and showing up counts more than talent most of the time, and this, Nadia feels, can be used to accomplish many goals that initially seem quite daunting. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-5-get-feedback-early">Lesson #5: Get feedback early<a class="hash-link" href="#lesson-5-get-feedback-early" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nadia had shown her first draft to the editor only after two months of grokking through it. In retrospect, she regrets delaying the process of getting feedback from her editor as she had to rewrite significant chunks during her second draft. That is why she feels that it is essential to get feedback as early as possible and get the book&#x27;s overall structure outlined and approved before diving into the actual writing. </p><p>In a way, it&#x27;s helpful to approach writing with an <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agile</a> mindset, shipping out the work fast and iterating several times based on the feedback, just like you would when you ship software by following agile processes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The primary lesson Nadia wished to impart through this talk was that she could successfully transition into her developer role because she reviewed the skills from her previous roles and tried to find some overlap with the skills required for her new roles. When she could not find that overlap, she approached the process of skill building like a craftsman: picking up things from scratch, refining her skills with inputs from the best, and learning to embrace the failures. </p><h1>Q &amp; A</h1><p>During the Q &amp; A section, the first question I asked Nadia was about her writing tools. She replied that she had not invested in any fancy writing software. Instead, she chose to stick to <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a>, where she could get comments from her editor. In addition to Google Docs, she used <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProWritingAid</a> for writing suggestions beyond the simple grammatical and spelling checks carried out on Google Docs.</p><p>I also asked her about her blogging experience. While she said that she did not blog much before becoming an author and only does so occasionally even now, she wrote a lot when she studied journalism and learned a good bit about writing as a copy editor. Even though she learned about writing in Russian, she was able to use her understanding of the mechanics of writing in one language to guide her writing in another language, English.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/writing">writing</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coding">coding</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2020 - 2022 Aadit Kamat.
