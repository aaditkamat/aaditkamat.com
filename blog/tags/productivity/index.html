Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just as industrialization had created physical consumer markets through surplus production of goods, digitalization has created digital consumer markets through surplus production of content. </p><p>It&#x27;s very easy to go down the rabbit hole of consumption once you get exposed to different kinds of information on the different media platforms. The main difference is that digital media platforms have access to more data and sophisticated algorithms to better analyze insights from the data so that they can essentially &quot;hack into your psychology&quot;. </p><p>This has become an even bigger problem <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-digital-addiction-made-worse-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to the pandemic</a> where people are cut off from each other due to social distancing and forced to spend more time at home, left to their digital devices. </p><p>I have experienced this personally. I used to be wary of using social media longer than intended before I enrolled in college. However, in a bid to form connections as a college student, I ended up mindlessly following a lot of people on different social media platforms. In particular, as I started spending more time at home after the pandemic, I found myself becoming addicted to Twitter. </p><p>Twitter seemed great as I had access to thoughts from different great minds on the planets via their Tweets. I also did not have to read news articles or watch the news channels - I could read the summaries on my Twitter feed instead. </p><p>I only began to grasp the gravity of the problem after I lashed out at my parents in anger, for no fault of theirs. As I reflected upon the cause of my anger, I realized it was due to pent-up frustration - the frustration triggered by all the social justice-related Tweets I had read. </p><p>I hadn&#x27;t been doing great in school up till that point, but I ended up sinking more time into social media than I should have and this most certainly contributed to my grades tanking.  </p><p>I can be impulsive, so once I read <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post written by Cal Newport that resonated with me</a>, I decided to deactivate most of my social media handles. This did help curb the addiction, but I soon realized that it wasn&#x27;t a good long-term solution. I found a <a href="https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-make-social-media-work-for-you-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better way to use social media</a>: to share the essays I was writing through the #Ship30for30 challenge or on my blog. </p><p>Going on &quot;social media lite&quot; made me understand an important principle that seems to apply in other areas as well: limit consumption and increase production. You have to consume as you need to learn from others. However, when you switch to the productivity mode, you switch to a mindset of what value do you provide - giving more than you take. </p><p>That&#x27;s why there is so much emphasis on productivity in the modern world. No matter what kind of work you do, you are providing some kind of value. You get paid precisely because you provide value. Your value increases when you focus on what you can give rather than what you receive in the form of benefits. </p><p>Even if we leave aside the career aspect of productivity aside, I believe that channeling productivity, such as through <a href="https://aaditkamat.github.io/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creativity, increases happiness</a> in the long run as it gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This comes in handy especially when you need to soldier through the challenges in life.</p><p>That is why the minimalist philosophy is so appealing. As you adopt this philosophy, you start to realize that you don&#x27;t need too much to be happy. This allows you to step down from the hedonistic treadmill, which leaves you craving for more and more. </p><p>Whilst the pandemic has been a major upheaval that left much destruction in its wake, it has also been a stark reminder of what truly matters: human connection and mental/physical wellbeing over materialistic wealth. Producing good work and sharing it with other people in the community who may benefit from it sparks true joy. Even when things don&#x27;t turn out the way you expected, which happens more often than not, you feel contented as you have given your best, which is all you could have done under the circumstances.</p><p>We cannot unplug ourselves from the internet, but the best way we can make sense of all the information we are exposed to without becoming overwhelmed is to use it to create something of our own and share it with others.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you to Manus Wong whose post on <a href="https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how consumerism is killing our creativity</a> echoed my sentiments on the topic and in turn inspired this post.</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Producing more than consuming" href="/blog/producing-more-than-consuming"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness">Creativity leads to happiness</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 30, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

It will be hard to answer such a profound question through the means of a single blog post, but I&#x27;ll just share what I think.</p><p>My view is that one of the ways to be happy is to be creative. </p><p>One of the most basic needs of mankind is to communicate. The process of communication itself involves quite a bit of creativity, because you are not only intrepreting what the other person(s) have said but also responding in a way that your brain constructs thoughts in real-time. As you reflect upon that, you start to realise that communication in itself is one of the basic acts of creativity that you perform daily. </p><p>Creativity is latent in your other activities as well. Dancing, cooking, singing and even the process of learning involves creativity, because you almost never reproduce the input you receive in its exact form. Instead, you add your own personal touch to it, without even meaning to sometimes. </p><p>Creativity is not a solitary process; you are integrating different bits and pieces, drawing from what you know and what you perceive from what others have shared with you. </p><p>As a result, plagiarism is an important issue in the field of intellectual property. If you are using something in its exact form, for example by including a quote in your writing, you need to cite it to give credit to the original author of that idea. Stealing other&#x27;s ideas without providing your input, in other words intellectual theft, does not promote growth. To effectively understand something, you have to put in a good amount of effort. This effort is directed towards wrestling with the difficulty of recreating the knowledge.</p><p>A quote by Viktor Frankl from his famous book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;A Man&#x27;s Search For Meaning&quot;</a> is in order here: &quot;In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.&quot; </p><p>Creative endeavors often seem like sinks of time and effort, especially when the results of the endeavours are not very clear. However, paradoxically it&#x27;s this suffering for the sake of others or for your own sake, that lends meaning to life.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Creativity leads to happiness" href="/blog/creativity-leads-to-happiness"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity">Embrace the messiness of creativity</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 19, 2021</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

However, as most of us will come to realise soon enough, analyzing the creative process retrospectively is not very useful. </p><p>Instead, we get better insights from analyzing the unfinished intermediaries which lead to that result. That is what students of creativity like Tiago Forte have done by <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/masters-of-creative-note-taking-luhmann-and-da-vinci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing notebooks of the greats like Leonardo Da Vinci or Luhmann&#x27;s Zettlekasten</a>. It gives you a better perspective of how creativity really looks like &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be looking at different activities in my own life: learning, conversing, exercising, coding and writing. By analyzing these, I&#x27;m going to share how I have come to realize that the only way to &quot;unlock&quot; your true creative potential is to embrace the messiness behind creativity.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="learning">Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As I&#x27;ve read through a lot of blog posts, articles and books related to learning, I derived an insight that should have seemed rather obvious: we create from what we learn. </p><p>As we learn in a very structured way within schools, we come to think of the general process in the same way but alas, if that were only true.</p><p>We may have gotten away with that in our earlier stages of education, but only, later on, do we come to realize that such rigidity does not help us spark the insights upon which we can continue future work.</p><p>Hence, one of the powerful techniques in learning any material well is <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interleaving</a> that is finding patterns within the seemingly unrelated things rather than sequentially approaching them.</p><p>This is best captured in the Steve Jobs quote of &quot;connecting the dots&quot; in his <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous Stanford lecture</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conversing">Conversing<a class="hash-link" href="#conversing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If that does not sound convincing enough, think about the way we converse with others in general. The process of conversing does not seem creative, but if you analyze it carefully enough it is packed with a lot of insights.</p><p>You are taking in a chunk or maybe even several chunks of what the other person is saying, interpreting it in your own way and essentially summarizing it before you respond in a fashion that seems agreeable.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that very complex in itself? It inevitably leads to miscommunication because we can&#x27;t fully grasp what the other person is necessarily trying to convey, even if he or she is doing a fantastic job and you are fully tuned in to the conversation. But that&#x27;s the messiness that is par for the course in any creative endeavour.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="coding">Coding<a class="hash-link" href="#coding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I had learnt coding back in high school but didn&#x27;t come to appreciate its complexity as I couldn&#x27;t undo the linear thinking patterns that I had picked up at the time as I was working on simple programs.</p><p>Hence, I was taken aback as I embarked upon my introductory Computer Science course where we learned slightly more advanced concepts because they didn&#x27;t fit into that model. </p><p>Coding requires thinking at different levels. First, you have to think at the function level as you are trying to build mini-programs. These functions have to be concise. That&#x27;s why most style guidelines would require you to keep your functions small, not more than say 20 lines.</p><p>You are then composing the functions into classes by combining them with data, the classes into individual files and the files into modules before you put them together into a system in a codebase as a whole.</p><p>At a time you may be focussing on only one level but you have to shuttle back and forth as you make changes to the codebase.</p><p>Unless you embrace the challenges of doing that and inevitably introducing bugs or having to fix other bugs or defects, you aren&#x27;t going to harness the power of coding.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="exercising">Exercising<a class="hash-link" href="#exercising" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Physical exercise has elements of non-linearity that define other creative processes incorporated within it as well. </p><p>Rather than grinding it out without trying to sufficient breaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT exercises are likely to get you better results</a>. This is because you are varying in between bursts of focus and breaks.</p><p>It is one thing to follow along with the trainers, but you can get the most out of it when you can customize the exercises best to your needs. This involves taking in chunks of what they are teaching and then adding in your personal touch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="writing">Writing<a class="hash-link" href="#writing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When you start out with writing, you may not be able to envision it as a creative activity. But as you become more experienced, you realise that it is not that far off from composing music or code. </p><p>You can achieve better results from mixing together notes and outlines to achieve that final written piece. </p><p>You have to first draft the piece from the atomic units and then edit it (sometimes copiously) before you have a result that you can sufficiently feel proud of.

We need some organisation principles, lest we get lost amid all the mess. That is where the &quot;focussed mode&quot; of our brains comes into the picture.</p><p>However, we need to embrace the &quot;diffused mode&quot; and leave enough room within that organisation to let that serendipity work its magic.</p><p>Even the organisation itself does not necessarily have to be fixed. With time, any organisational system will undergo change. Hence, it is not to sweat the details and instead get started with an organisational principle that you can incrementally modify over time.</p><p>It&#x27;s tempting to obsess over certain systems and even to discard your old ones that don&#x27;t seem to fit well with your personal philosophy. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times myself as well. However, I find that you will be most motivated and in turn be able to motivate others, only when you create access to your own personal history of creativity.</p><p>Creativity in itself is an &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon: you work away at parts of it that are atomic and then combine them, either with your own work or others, before the final result emerges. This leads to messiness but you have to be comfortable with that before you get to bigger and better results.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Embrace the messiness of creativity" href="/blog/embrace-the-messiness-of-creativity"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/its-ok-to-forget">It&#x27;s Ok To Forget</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 11, 2021</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.</p><p>My own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="forgetting-curve">Forgetting curve<a class="hash-link" href="#forgetting-curve" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>That is because our brain has a &quot;forgetting curve&quot; just as it has a &quot;learning curve&quot;: you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.
The dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-role-of-intention">The role of intention<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-of-intention" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Your brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. </p><p>However, it&#x27;s unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-importance-of-context">The importance of context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Angela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="much-room-for-misinterpretation">Much room for misinterpretation<a class="hash-link" href="#much-room-for-misinterpretation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. </p><p>As Stephen says towards the end, &quot;My job is to write and the reader&#x27;s job is to read and forget&quot;. In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/podcasts">podcasts</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about It&#x27;s Ok To Forget" href="/blog/its-ok-to-forget"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system">Writing as an external data processing system</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2021</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As I started to think more about writing online, I often wondered to myself about how people would write before the printing press was invented. The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled &quot;Memory Overload&quot;. It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn&#x27;t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven&#x27;t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn&#x27;t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer&#x27;s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer&#x27;s ideas.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Writing as an external data processing system" href="/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/staying-focussed-amidst-distractions">Staying focussed amidst distractions</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 3, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn&#x27;t dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Staying focussed amidst distractions" href="/blog/staying-focussed-amidst-distractions"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/power-of-habit">Power of Habit</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 24, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

How many of these things do you do consciously and how many of them have become a part of your routine? An introspection of our daily routines makes us realise how much of our lifestyle is habitual, built up over a long time.</p><p>Habits can be both good and bad. Tapping into insights from neuroscience can help you undo those habits that do not benefit you and create new ones that will help enrich your life. The actions required to carry out these tasks, no matter how complex, get recorded in a region of our long-term memory known as the Basal Ganglia. As a result, we can fetch the information required for these tasks effortlessly from our brain. </p><p>One of the key elements of developing any habit is practice. For the actions to be stored in our memory effectively, we need to be able to repeat them a sufficient number of times. Another important element of developing a habit is to create a positive reward loop around it. Thinking of how the habit fits into the long term picture will help you stick with it when the going gets tough. Last but not the least, have a plan of action for how you will go about forming the habit and what you will do if that does not work out. This will also help build up the resilience that is needed for habit formation.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Power of Habit" href="/blog/power-of-habit"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/inculcating-a-reading-habit">Inculcating a reading habit</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 23, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

After graduating from college though, I&#x27;ve come to realize that it is important to inculcate a reading habit.</p><p>Reading exposes you to the ideas espoused by different authors. While reading up on topics that you have expertise in will benefit you from a career perspective, it can also be illuminating to read works from other areas. For example, a lot of people like to read self help books. These often emphasize timeless principles that can be applied to different areas of your life to improve them. Some of the self-help books that I look forward to reading are Deep Work and Digital Minimalism, both written by Cal Newport as well as Atomic Habits by James Clear.</p><p>Reading, however, becomes effective only if you can apply those key ideas to enrich your life. That is how you actively learn from the material, like you would when you read the course materials for your examinations. The key difference is that you are aiming for a different long term goal: self-improvement.</p><p>Reading is also important for aspiring writers, because it allows them to generate the ideas they need to convert into writing. A handy tip that I have come across is that you need to strike a balance between how much you consume and how much your produce, with a good rule of thumb being that the time spent on the former does not exceed the time spent on the latter, especially as you are starting out.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Inculcating a reading habit" href="/blog/inculcating-a-reading-habit"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/you-need-to-sleep">You need to sleep</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 21, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aadit Kamat</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer @ Visa Singapore.

Not only is your phone&#x27;s blue light bad for your sleeping habit, but your phone time eats away at the time you need to do other things which are more important. In the end, you have to do those anyway, so this pushes back your sleeping time.</p><p>One helpful suggestion for getting enough sleep is creating a sleep routine. Once your body gets used to going to bed and waking up at the same time, it becomes a habit.

The reason I did so is that I&#x27;m impressed with all the work he has done outside his full-time job as a Computer Science professor, which in itself is a demanding job. </p><p>As a result, I came upon a website called mymorningroutine.com. This website provides transcripts of conversations that the team behind the My Morning Routine magazine had with about 343 professionals who have achieved success in their respective endeavours, from writing to entrepreneurship. </p><p>It would be fallacious to say that all of these individuals owe their success primarily to their morning routines, as that is inferring causation from correlation. However, reading through some of these interviews has reinforced my belief that a routine, as boring as it sounds, is indeed an ingredient for success.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Importance of a daily routine" href="/blog/importance-of-a-daily-routine"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/tags/productivity/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Aadit Kamat.
