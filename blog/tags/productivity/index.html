The advent of the printing press made it much easier to create copies and distribute, which led to a boom in the publishing industry. This effect has only been magnified as people have switched from pen and paper to computers. How then did people end up writing, before the processes integral to writing, such as copying and editing, became mainstream?</p><p>I found what I was looking for in a chapter of the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari titled &quot;Memory Overload&quot;. It is astonishing that many of the epics we know today such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad or the Mahabharata were passed down through the generations via oral traditions. These indicate that Homo Sapiens have always had a great knack for devising stories that could convey important life lessons.</p><p>However, without the aid of writing, Homo Sapiens could only operate within small bands. Organising in large numbers, as we see today, seem to require humans to come up with elaborate fictions that serve as the binding glue. Keeping track of the incomes and expenditures as well as the taxes paid by the citizens quickly became cumbersome for our human brains as populations governed under such systems expanded dramatically.</p><p>As a result, ancient societies like the Sumerians in 3500 BC invented the partial script as a convenient way of keeping a record of such transactions. This script bears closer resemblance to the mathematical script that we have all become familiar with today. It wasn&#x27;t sufficient for expressing most of the complexity underlying spoken modes of communication, but it suited the purpose for which it was invented perfectly. As writing was difficult and the audience was small, the Sumerians saw no need to transition to a full script to capture speech. </p><p>However, the writing scene started to develop dramatically once forms of written script (collectively known today as the cuneiform) started to show up in different societies such as those in Egypt, China and Central America between 3000 BC and 2500 BC.</p><p>Today, writing has become an essential part of human communication, a skill that everyone should aim to master. Even as tools that aid writing have become more sophisticated and our collective proficiencies in expressing ourselves have improved significantly due to a greater emphasis on education, the task of writing itself has not become any simpler. The bottleneck is due to our thinking capabilities, not typing or editing capabilities.</p><p>As I see it, writers aim to learn from others as well as share what they have learned, based on their perspectives. As a result, there are limitations that the writer has to navigate to communicate effectively with their audience. </p><p>As a writer, you are not completely sure that you haven&#x27;t erred in your intrepretations of ideas. You cannot know what your audience will glean from your writings, as an audience constitutes of individuals and individuals differ greatly in their personalities and capabilities.</p><p>That, however, shouldn&#x27;t stop a writer from writing, because that means he will stop learning and hence, growing. A writer can only press forward with his actions and good intentions. How the writing proliferates is outside of his control.</p><p>This is how the audience becomes a part of the writer&#x27;s data processing system, his extended mind so to speak, that churns through the writer&#x27;s ideas.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Writing as an external data processing system" href="/blog/writing-as-an-external-data-processing-system"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/staying-focussed-amidst-distractions">Staying focussed amidst distractions</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">August 3, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The modern world is filled with distractions. You just have to take out your phone and lo behold, there are so many applications vying for your immediate attention.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t enough distractions before the digital era. In fact, the tendency to shift focus to the thing that immediately captured attention was a trait that kept us humans alive back when we were in the savannahs, as we never knew what threats lay around the corner. We couldn&#x27;t dedicate our fullest attention to one task only and had to multitask for self preservation.</p><p>Though this makes sense from an evolutionary psychology standpoint, we have had to make rapid changes to our lifestyle quite rapidly over the course of the last few centuries. As we look at all the notifications from the different apps on our phones, check emails frequently to stay on top of our work or scroll through social media feeds for entertainment purposes, we feel as though we are more productive.</p><p>However, a couple of studies have shown that such multitasking can in fact be detrimental to our mental heatlth and productivity. Those who multitask often over the course of the day end up feeling more burnout as stress accumulates. That is why it is important now more than ever to devote our attention to the tasks at hand, dealing with them one by one, and minimize the distractions.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Staying focussed amidst distractions" href="/blog/staying-focussed-amidst-distractions"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/power-of-habit">Power of Habit</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 24, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Try to think of all the things you do when you wake up in the morning: brush your teeth, take a morning shower, catch up on the news, eat breakfast. How many of these things do you do consciously and how many of them have become a part of your routine? An introspection of our daily routines makes us realise how much of our lifestyle is habitual, built up over a long time.</p><p>Habits can be both good and bad. Tapping into insights from neuroscience can help you undo those habits that do not benefit you and create new ones that will help enrich your life. The actions required to carry out these tasks, no matter how complex, get recorded in a region of our long-term memory known as the Basal Ganglia. As a result, we can fetch the information required for these tasks effortlessly from our brain. </p><p>One of the key elements of developing any habit is practice. For the actions to be stored in our memory effectively, we need to be able to repeat them a sufficient number of times. Another important element of developing a habit is to create a positive reward loop around it. Thinking of how the habit fits into the long term picture will help you stick with it when the going gets tough. Last but not the least, have a plan of action for how you will go about forming the habit and what you will do if that does not work out. This will also help build up the resilience that is needed for habit formation.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Power of Habit" href="/blog/power-of-habit"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/inculcating-a-reading-habit">Inculcating a reading habit</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 23, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Since high school, I have fallen behind on my reading habit. After graduating from college though, I&#x27;ve come to realize that it is important to inculcate a reading habit.</p><p>Reading exposes you to the ideas espoused by different authors. While reading up on topics that you have expertise in will benefit you from a career perspective, it can also be illuminating to read works from other areas. For example, a lot of people like to read self help books. These often emphasize timeless principles that can be applied to different areas of your life to improve them. Some of the self-help books that I look forward to reading are Deep Work and Digital Minimalism, both written by Cal Newport as well as Atomic Habits by James Clear.</p><p>Reading, however, becomes effective only if you can apply those key ideas to enrich your life. That is how you actively learn from the material, like you would when you read the course materials for your examinations. The key difference is that you are aiming for a different long term goal: self-improvement.</p><p>Reading is also important for aspiring writers, because it allows them to generate the ideas they need to convert into writing. A handy tip that I have come across is that you need to strike a balance between how much you consume and how much your produce, with a good rule of thumb being that the time spent on the former does not exceed the time spent on the latter, especially as you are starting out.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Inculcating a reading habit" href="/blog/inculcating-a-reading-habit"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/you-need-to-sleep">You need to sleep</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 21, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I love to sleep. I mean, who doesn&#x27;t honestly? At the same time, I&#x27;m also quite fussy about my sleep. If I get more sleep than I need, I feel like I&#x27;m being lazy. On the other hand, if I sleep too less, I end up feeling more tired. I&#x27;ve been trying for that sweet spot of 7 hours.</p><p>Of course, different people have different requirements. If you can subsist on less sleep, then go ahead by all means. At the end of the day, you know what&#x27;s best for your own body.</p><p>What&#x27;s important is that you don&#x27;t skimp on the hours that your body actually needs. If this starts to become a habit, it&#x27;s time to introspect. Is this habit a result of huge workload or poor time management?</p><p>One of the main reasons this can happen is that you are spending more time on activities you shouldn&#x27;t like being on your phone. Not only is your phone&#x27;s blue light bad for your sleeping habit, but your phone time eats away at the time you need to do other things which are more important. In the end, you have to do those anyway, so this pushes back your sleeping time.</p><p>One helpful suggestion for getting enough sleep is creating a sleep routine. Once your body gets used to going to bed and waking up at the same time, it becomes a habit. You may even realize that you don&#x27;t need an alarm clock to get up any more.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about You need to sleep" href="/blog/you-need-to-sleep"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/importance-of-a-daily-routine">Importance of a daily routine</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 20, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was in college, I didn&#x27;t use to give much thought to how I should plan out my day. It isn&#x27;t surprising, given that the nature of college life is hectic and variable. The workload for the semester changes depending on the number of credits you need to clear, what specialization you wish to pursue, and in general what your goals are for that semester.</p><p>However, as a college graduate who has now joined the workforce, it&#x27;s essential for me to adhere to a daily routine. This is because work starts and ends every day at about fairly the same time and there are other tasks I need to do as part of my routine, such as writing, for example. </p><p>Other than that, I also feel that the routine is what will give me the strength to persist with longer term goals, especially when the going gets tough. If the day shapes out to be haphazard, it will eventually impact the quality of my life.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I looked up Cal Newport&#x27;s daily routine recently. The reason I did so is that I&#x27;m impressed with all the work he has done outside his full-time job as a Computer Science professor, which in itself is a demanding job. </p><p>As a result, I came upon a website called mymorningroutine.com. This website provides transcripts of conversations that the team behind the My Morning Routine magazine had with about 343 professionals who have achieved success in their respective endeavours, from writing to entrepreneurship. </p><p>It would be fallacious to say that all of these individuals owe their success primarily to their morning routines, as that is inferring causation from correlation. However, reading through some of these interviews has reinforced my belief that a routine, as boring as it sounds, is indeed an ingredient for success.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Importance of a daily routine" href="/blog/importance-of-a-daily-routine"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How To Learn</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 19, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>This morning, I started reading a book called &quot;Learn Like A Pro&quot; by Barbara Oakley. I had taken her course &quot;Learning How To Learn&quot;, which was one of the most popular MOOCs on Coursera at the time. </p><p>Even though the course had a lot of useful tips for students, I did not end up applying those in my own college studies at NUS, which I suspect is one of the reasons I did not fare well.</p><p>One of the tips that Barbara shares in the book is breaking your study time into chunks using the Pomodoro technique. Even when it seems like a task takes variable amounts of time to complete, I&#x27;d highly suggest sticking to this technique. </p><p>This is because 25 minutes is the perfect amount of time to maintain focus on the task, and completing a Pomodoro gives your brain that dopamine boost it needs to stay motivated, especially if the task at hand is arduous. </p><p>Another important aspect of the Pomodoro technique is that it allows you to schedule breaks in between your work. Taking breaks is important for your brain to transition from the focussed mode, where it forages all the necessary information for the task, to the diffuse mode where it can make connections between disparate strands of information to give you a higher-level picture, or a mental model, based on that information.</p><p>Even as I have graduated from college, I have come to realise that it&#x27;s important for me to improve my learning performance. Hence, I would recommend this book to learners of all ages so that you can better understand how the brain works and apply insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology to take charge of your own learning.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/personal-growth">personal growth</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Learning How To Learn" href="/blog/learning-how-to-learn"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/learning-to-embrace-boredom">Learning To Embrace Boredom</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">July 16, 2021 Â· 2 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30969577?s=400&amp;u=9558fc3557d79c88a7080034fe8c22654aca2e4d&amp;v=4" alt="Aadit Kamat"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/aaditkamat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aadit Kamat</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">QA Engineer @ Shopee</small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I have a lot of work to do to improve my relationship with boredom.

That is why when I first heard Cal Newport speak about how boredom can in fact be crucial when you are doing deep work, I felt that his words resonated with me. </p><p>To be fair, Newport says that he does not lionize boredom the way some others studying original thinkers do. However, he says that there is enough research literature that points towards doing the boring &quot;deep work&quot; and then taking a break from it to do something else, something mundane or ritualistic, as being key for generating great ideas. In such cases, the brain works in the background even as the human body is carrying out other tasks not remotely connected to the field of thought that the brain is pursuing.</p><p>When you are working on any long term project, you are bound to go through stretches of boredom followed by periods of insight. Trying to tackle the boredom by switching to another window to catch up on email, Slack notifications or the social media feed leaves the brain with insufficient time to think about the problems that we wish to solve. This has reshaped my belief that boredom can actually be a good thing and should be embraced for longer-term success.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/productivity">productivity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Learning To Embrace Boredom" href="/blog/learning-to-embrace-boredom"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Aadit Kamat.
