Through the term technology, I'm referring to a range of different porducts and services that have been made available to us through scientific progress. However in recent times, this term has started to be used in a more narrow sense, to describe computers like laptops and personal computers or devices in which computers have been embedded like mobile devices. 

Technology has helped improve the lives of mankind. A comfortable lifestyle is no longer accessible just to the rich and elite but also within the reach of individuals that fall in the middle-income category.

However, there are pros and cons to anything that becomes a part of our daily lives. As the American economist Herbert Simon once said, "abundance of information creates a poverty of attention". The huge amount of content that is available on the internet has also become a source of distractions. Distractions prevent us from focussing on things that truly matter to us. When we end up sinking time into applications, we lose out and the businesses who have created these applications profit. 

That is why it is important to change our relationship with technology. Rather than let it dictate our lives, we need to take charge of our time and attention, two of the most valuable resources we have, and use only the technologies that benefit us. This requires practicing digital minimalism: decluttering your digital life by getting rid of technologies that don't provide value.
