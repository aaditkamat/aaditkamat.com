Let's face it, all of us are surrounded by a lot of information right now, produced by a large number of creators that exist within the digital landscape. Having access to such a large amount of information at our fingertips gives us the impression that we are becoming smarter. But are we really? Or is all that information confusing us instead?


In a recent conversation with a friend, I shared with her why I had decided to limit my social media usage. 

One of the reasons why I did so is because I noticed that my relationship with social media had started to change in college and took a turn for the worst after the pandemic. Another reason that inspired to me to make this change was an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science professor at the Georgetown University who writes about the intersection of tech and culture. He advocates quitting social media altogether and emphasises the need for digital minimalism required for to do "deep work", or long periods of focused work with minimal distractions.


I know that it's impractical for a lot of people to quit social media altogether, especially those whose work relies heavily on it. I find Newport's watered down stance more useful in this regard: Spend some time away from your devices to reassess your relationship with technology. Pick the tools that are in alignment with your goals. 

The way I see it, this will establish a bottom up relationship with technology driven by personal needs rather than a top down relationship where you end up adding more apps that seem useful but just aren't.
