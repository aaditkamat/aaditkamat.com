[The loving-kindness meditation](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/26-guided-meditation-on-love/?hilite=Meditation+Love) is an excellent daily meditation. Every now and then, I love coming back to it and hope that I will do so even more in the future.

This meditation teaches you the power of selfless, unconditional love. The practice of unconditional love appears in a lot of ancient traditions and cultures around the world. 
[The Agape tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape), [the Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) and [Vasudhaiva Kutumbakham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhaiva_Kutumbakam) are just some of the traditions that leap to mind.

There are times when I am misanthropic, when I feel that our humanity is rotten to the core and we cannot expect any better. This happens often when I explore the dark side of humanity, especially as it is depicted in some forms of media. 

In the media, human drama appears to emphasize both the positive and negative sides of human behaviour, often not in conjunction but rather separately. Therefore, we end up focusing on only one side, rather than seeing both sides equally, as we would if we observed human behaviour daily. 

We also tend to focus more on the negative side of things because of our [negativity bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/negativity-bias), where as many as [five positive experiences may be required to overcome the effects of one negative experience](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/).

At some point though, even these positive and negative labels do not suffice to describe human experiences. It employs a [binary mode of thinking](https://medium.com/@JayBeDreamin/the-dangers-of-binary-thinking-why-context-matters-f69fe1f4a2e2) as a heuristic to simplify a complex world.

First, there is some degree of subjectivity involved in evaluating experiences this way, as what appears positive to one may appear negative to another and vice versa. Second, there is a major chunk of human experiences that simply cannot be categorised this way.

Take for instance a person travelling on a bus or a train. If the person is enjoying themselves having a conversation with another, they can label that experience as positive. On the other hand, if they get into an altercation with the person during that conversation, they can label that experience as negative. But what about all the time spent in between where the person is not engaged in one thing or the other? Both the labels do not suffice to categorize such an experience. 

On an individual level, therefore, taking stock of your [roses, thorns and buds](https://lifedesignlog.com/rose-thorn-bud-activity-for-group-presentations/) helps you analyse your experiences on a spectrum.

Contrasted with the destructive feeling of misanthropy is the feeling of unconditional love that I find myself gravitating towards more strongly. I feel that it holds greater power and leaves you with a more lasting feeling of contentedness, even if it is just as temporal as all other feelings are. 

This meditation teaches you how to practice unconditional love by thinking of it as [expanding your circle of moral compassion](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals). You start with yourself, branch out towards your kith and kin, your colleagues and friends, your countrymen, other humans and ultimately towards all beings.

Do give this meditation a try. I’m sure you’ll be the better for it.
