Over the weekend, I read a short story written by Stephen King called “Elevation”.

## Summary

Scott Carey is a 6-foot-four tall overweight American male living in a small town called Castle Rock in New England. He approaches Dr Bob Ellis to tell him about his unique situation: he has been experiencing weight loss, even as his mass has remained unchanged. Furthermore, he weighs the same undressed as he does with several layers of clothing on. Dr Bob, at first, does not believe Scott’s predicament, but is forced to accept it when Scott demonstrates using the doctor’s own precise weighing scales.

Scott has a strained relationship with his neighbours Dierdre McComb and Missy Donaldson, a married lesbian couple that has recently moved into Castle Rock. Scott is annoyed that Dierdre continues to let her dogs do their business in his lawn. Whenever Scott tries to share his problem with Dierdre, she dismisses him with a smile that indicates that she is least interested to listen to him. Scott hopes that they will be on good terms and that Dierdre behaves more like a good neighbour.

Scott soon finds out why the couple is unhappy in Castle Rock. Deirdre and Missy’s restaurant in Castle Town, Holy Frijole, has not been doing that well as of late. A major reason behind this is that the town’s inhabitants disapprove of Diedre and Missy because they openly declared themselves as a married lesbian couple. Castle Rock is in a county politically inclined towards Republican ideology and the residents see this open declaration as a form of political statement. 

Scott tries to stand up for the ladies as one of the employees in the Castle Rock Public Works department makes unsavoury comments about them. However, this makes things only worse, because Deirdre feels that they had been cast again into the spotlight, just as their sexual orientation was fading away from the minds of Castle Rock’s residents

In a last attempt to make amends, Scott decides to participate in the town’s annual 12K Thanksgiving run, an event that Dierdre is also participating in, and place a wager on the winner of the competition. Diedre is a skilled marathon runner and is confident of her chances of winning. She hopes that winning will be a shot at redeeming lost glory, a chance to show to the others in Castle Rock that she is more than just her sexual orientation. Even though Scott looks clearly out of shape, he feels optimistic about his chances due to his weight loss.

Scott easily clears the first 8K of the marathon, but starts struggling for the next 2K, until the “wind changes'' and he regains his momentum. Towards the end, in the midst of heavy rain and thunder that erupts as the weather changes, he overtakes Dierdre and even helps her up to her feet when she stumbles, so that she can go on to win the race. The incident is reported in the local newspaper and Scott’s act of kindness is lauded by the Castle Rock residents. Holy Frijole’s business starts to boom, and Dierdre warms up to Scott.

After the race, Scott meets Dierdre and Missy for lunch, along with Doctor Bob and his wife Myra, as per the terms of the wager that Scott won. Scott then confides with them about the weird phenomenon he has been experiencing. The rate at which Scott had been losing weight had accelerated and he was expecting to be weightless by January next year. 

This revelation brings all of them even closer. They try to make the most of Scott’s last few days, meeting up for lunch often at Holy Frijole. Scott wants Deidre to be the one that sets him free at the point where he loses all his weight, because he knows that she understands the feeling of being “elevated” - a state she herself reaches when she runs for a marathon, where she can forget all the blemishes of her character and become the best version of herself. 

Even though Scott is going to die, he does so with the knowledge that he will not die buried in the ground, but rather soaring up in the skies.

## Thoughts

I have heard about Stephen King a lot from my friend. Of course, I have also enjoyed the films Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, which are based on his novels. He is a very talented storyteller, who is able to draw you into the story right from the beginning. 

The premise of this novel is novel: who would have thought a person would die of weightlessness on Earth, as the gravitational pull on him decreases rapidly? It is yet again Stephen King foray into the supernatural. He hints at a reality that is outside human understanding. As Scott says, weight is just a construct that helps man understand his physical reality better like time. 

The book is not nearly as dark or foreboding as some of the other Stephen King ones, because Scott is generally happy even though he is acutely aware of his terminal illness. He is also able to make amends with the McCombes and enlist the help of Dierdre for his final journey. 

Though I have never been to a small town in America - the closest is probably the college town of Chapel Hill which I visited during my exchange - I felt a sense of warmth reading about the close relationships that the town’s inhabitants share, even if it accompanies the gossip and the prejudices often associated with a closed mentality. It reminded me of the TV Shows I have watched or books I have read about the villages in India or small towns in England.
