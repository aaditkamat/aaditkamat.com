            <description><![CDATA[Recently, I was listening to Rise by Jack & Jack. It stirred up memories of my trip to the United States back in 2018. I experienced a mental boost due to the nostalgic value that the song held for me. I now realize why music is said to have therapeutic effects. It can elevate your mood.]]></description>

As most of us will be aware through our personal experiences though, it is impossible to achieve everlasting happiness. Life is like a bag of experiences, those that give us joy mixed with others that bring us grief.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Youngsters like me are always on a look out for advice that can help us make the best use of our time and set ourselves up for the future. Advice from elders are usually packed with insights. They wish to convey information that they think is important for us youngsters to know. This way we don't have to reinvent the wheel and go through the same struggles they did.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This afternoon, as I was watching the videos for a React Native course on Udemy, I came across an image that I found quite inspirational. In this image, success has been described in terms of an iceberg illusion. A success story is like the tip of an iceberg. When you hear about it, you are exposed to only one portion, the portion that worked right, but are unaware of what's hidden beneath. Those hidden portions of the story, such as the sacrifices made by the individual, the perseverance despite setbacks, and the determination to forge ahead are left out either because it's easy to forget them when you reflect on the story retrospectively or because they do not appear glamorous enough.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Try to think of all the things you do when you wake up in the morning: brush your teeth, take a morning shower, catch up on the news, eat breakfast. How many of these things do you do consciously and how many of them have become a part of your routine? An introspection of our daily routines makes us realise how much of our lifestyle is habitual, built up over a long time.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As of late, I have found myself unsubscribing from a lot of email newsletters. While some such as the Morning Brew are important for me to catch up with the news for the day, others just don't provide me as much value as I had expected when I first signed up for them. I am particularly annoyed by the newsletters that I get from different companies informing me about their latest events or products and services starting to get a little annoying. Yes Apple, I'm talking about all those emails you have sent me for the 1-year Apple TV+ subscription or the 6 months free Apple Music subscription that I absolutely do not need at this point.]]></description>
