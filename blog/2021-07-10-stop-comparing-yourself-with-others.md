As I have had issues with self-confidence and compared myself with others, I was naturally drawn towards this question: Is comparison always a negative tendency? 

Well, as in other matters in life, there is no straightforward answer because comparison can have positive as well as negative consequences.


I was listening to an episode on the podcast No Stupid Questions recently, where the hosts Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner were addressing the same question. Angela said that it is important to evaluate the tendency to compare from an evolutionary psychology standpoint. 

Humans tend to compare their lives with lives of those who seem to be doing better because they wish to improve their lives. This is known as upward social comparison. This can be positive if the person does not get discouraged by others' accomplishments, but tends to have detrimental effects on the person's mental health if done too often.


On the other hand, a person may also experience schadenfreude, taking joy at someone's suffering. This is an example of downward social comparison. It rarely brings any benefit, since it does not improve the person's own wellbeing and may make the person feel guilty for experiencing such emotions instead.


I would conclude by saying that everyone needs to introspect and control this tendency if it is harming them. This is easier said than done, but you can only grow as a person if you seek to improve by competing with yourself, not with others.
