As of late, I have found myself unsubscribing from a lot of email newsletters. While some such as the Morning Brew are important for me to catch up with the news for the day, others just don't provide me as much value as I had expected when I first signed up for them. I am particularly annoyed by the newsletters that I get from different companies informing me about their latest events or products and services starting to get a little annoying. Yes Apple, I'm talking about all those emails you have sent me for the 1-year Apple TV+ subscription or the 6 months free Apple Music subscription that I absolutely do not need at this point.


As I seek a minimalist digital lifestyle, it's important for me to unsubscribe from all those newsletters that I find clogging up my inbox. While this task has become more difficult as I've unwittingly ended up inviting emails from a lot of different service providers over time, either by opting for the newsletters knowingly or doing so unknowingly while registering for an account, there are online tools like Unroll.me and clean.email that have come to my aid to clear up my inbox.


I believe that having a clean inbox is a significant productivity boost because it helps you declutter your mind and focus only on those emails that truly matter. Overflowing email has acquired the proportions of a first-world problem that many of us face in this digital age, but it doesn't have to be a nightmare. Make sure you take some time out this weekend to attend to this chore, so you don't have to stress out about it when you get back to work.
