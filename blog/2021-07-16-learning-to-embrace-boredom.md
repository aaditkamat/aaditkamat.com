I'll be the first to admit, I have a lot of work to do to improve my relationship with boredom. I don't necessarily think that boredom is something that must be avoided at all costs, but it does make me uncomfortable. It lulls me into the false trap of thinking that I'm not being productive.

Over the course of time, I've come to realize that this notion is inaccurate and can even be detrimental. That is why when I first heard Cal Newport speak about how boredom can in fact be crucial when you are doing deep work, I felt that his words resonated with me. 

To be fair, Newport says that he does not lionize boredom the way some others studying original thinkers do. However, he says that there is enough research literature that points towards doing the boring "deep work" and then taking a break from it to do something else, something mundane or ritualistic, as being key for generating great ideas. In such cases, the brain works in the background even as the human body is carrying out other tasks not remotely connected to the field of thought that the brain is pursuing.

When you are working on any long term project, you are bound to go through stretches of boredom followed by periods of insight. Trying to tackle the boredom by switching to another window to catch up on email, Slack notifications or the social media feed leaves the brain with insufficient time to think about the problems that we wish to solve. This has reshaped my belief that boredom can actually be a good thing and should be embraced for longer-term success.
