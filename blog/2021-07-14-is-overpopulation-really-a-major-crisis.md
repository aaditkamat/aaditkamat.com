I've viewed the growth in human population over the last century in a negative light. I remember discussing this issue with a relative who brought up the point about how the population has grown from less than a billion in the 1800s to a whopping figure of 7.9 billion, quadrupling over the last century. 

He described it as the elephant in the room, the issue that was not being discussed with as much fervour as say climate change. A growing population meant more mouths to feed and this would eventually place constraints on governments who have to cater to the demands of the populace. 

In particular, he mentioned how the progress that India had made in terms of GDP growth seemed to be evened out by the population growth. In view of these issues, the efforts made by governments to tackle population growth such as China's former one-child policy and the two-child policy now being promoted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India seem more than welcome.

Watching a Kurzgesagt video on overpopulation however, changed my perspective on it. Instead of focussing on the doom and gloom that is generally associated with a burgeoning population, the video addressed the trends in demographic transition that have emerged in developing countries like Bangladesh, which mirror those that had been seen in the now-developed countries like Britain post-industrialisation. 

Due to improvements in healthcare, growing life spans and more educated citizens, the birth rates have started to decline and the population growth has more or less stabilised. This paints a more positive picture of the road ahead, if other countries lagging behind begin to follow this trend, with help from the developed countries.
