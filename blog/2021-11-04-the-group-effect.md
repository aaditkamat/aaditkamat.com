We can never achieve things as individuals. Individuals in themselves are too erratic - they experience much change over their lifetimes, they have underlying motivations that are too complex, their minds waver too much.

I feel that the analogies from physics provide good abstractions to understand chaos at an individual level. Think of particles in a gaseous substance. They are separate from each other because the binding forces are weak. When bound in a container, they bounce around and collide with each other at times. It's almost impossible to predict the velocity and position of each individual particle. However, when you think of the substance as a whole, it has some predictable properties that have been well-studied.

Let's shift gears a little, still remaining within the physical realm. Now think about atoms in a [radioactive material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay). It is again almost impossible to predict when the individual atom will decay because the process is probabilistic. However, the rate of radioactive decay of the material as a whole is well-defined.

As suggested by Warren Weaver in his influential article ["Science and Complexity"](https://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf), science itself went through a paradigm shift as we studied data from many different individual phenomena and applied the law of large numbers to analyze this data to solve problems of disorganized complexity. This data is often distributed in some manner which gives us patterns to extrapolate and predict. An individual event is too random, but the predictions we can make based on the patterns we observe are more certain.

Even from a sociological perspective, there are phenomena that help us understand this group effect better. An example that comes to mind is the "collective wisdom" phenomenon demonstrated by a study that journalist James Suroweicki describes in his book ["Wisdom of the Crowds",](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1636023205&sr=1-2) where a large number of people were able to predict the number of marbles in a jar when individual guesses tended to be way off.

An irony is that even as a lot of us may be aware of these group effects through our studies of the sciences, we see ourselves as just a little bit special than others. That is why we may see our lives are different and view them with a preferential bias that gets shattered when outlier events, termed as [black swan events by statistician Nassim Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) occur in our lives. As Daniel Kahneman points out in his book ["Thinking Fast and Slow",](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) even scientific researchers, whom you would generally hold to a higher standard, suffer from such systematic biases.

The reality, however, is that we are interdependent, interconnected. Despite our uniqueness, in the larger scheme of things, we are no more than a statistic. Each of our lives is thus of equal importance: no more, no less. This is best captured in the philosophy of [dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) that is central to all Schools of Buddhism - nothing exists in itself, but exists only in conjunction with others.
