This afternoon, as I was watching the videos for a React Native course on Udemy, I came across an image that I found quite inspirational. In this image, success has been described in terms of an iceberg illusion. A success story is like the tip of an iceberg. When you hear about it, you are exposed to only one portion, the portion that worked right, but are unaware of what's hidden beneath. Those hidden portions of the story, such as the sacrifices made by the individual, the perseverance despite setbacks, and the determination to forge ahead are left out either because it's easy to forget them when you reflect on the story retrospectively or because they do not appear glamorous enough.

The human journey is beset with failures. Some will feel minor, like bumps on an otherwise smooth road, while others can be major setbacks. As a human, it is natural to experience dejection after you face failures, especially if they keep coming.  The mistakes you make during failures are often alternate paths towards your goals and you find the right path only after several iterations. Learning from those mistakes is what helps us improve and grow.
