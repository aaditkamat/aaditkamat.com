<b>Prompt: Share a threshold you crossed - what you expected it to be like, how that differed from reality, and what it took to make it through</b>

I can distinctly recall the time I was waiting for the final examination results for my CBSE Class 12 All India Secondary School Certificate Examinations (AISSCE), back in June 2015. I could barely sleep the night before, as I wondered what results my efforts had accomplished. In my mind, the results were the entry ticket to a prestigious college – either here in Singapore or in the US. All while I was trying to get over the culture shock of being a recruit at the National Service Training Institute (NSTI) and completing the Basic Rescue Training as part of my National Service obligations.

To all the high school students awaiting for their results pensively, I wish to convey this: examinations are a part and parcel of student life. Use them as tools to gauge your grasp of concepts, not as tools to judge your self-worth.

I know that this is easier said than done, but believe me, just acknowledging this to yourself from time to time helps make the process easier. My hope is that this journal entry will be useful to you in getting over that anxiety. To all the other readers out there, if you are looking for some inspiration to overcome your hurdles, you are welcome to read this piece as well.

So how did I get into this situation? Let me give you all some context to understand my predicament. I was of an academic bent back in my high school years. Instead of participating in any kind of sports or recreational activities, I spent most of my time taking down notes, revising my study material and poring through the textbooks for insights.

As I performed well in my examinations and stayed on top of my homework, I was in the good books of my teachers. However, missing out on other aspects of the educational experience meant that it was not holistic enough. I was not taking good care of my health, my social life was virtually non-existent and I had no practical knowledge to supplement my theoretical knowledge from academic material.

I realized how woefully inadept I was at “roughing it out” when I enlisted into NSTI as a recruit. Not only was I burst out of the social bubble of Indians that I was interacting with during my time at the Global Indian International School, I was also no longer the stellar student. Instead, I was fledgling, as a nondescript recruit trying to complete my basic tasks and responsibilities. I was not particularly good at collaborating with fellow recruits who stayed in the same bunk and I kept getting reprimanded by my instructors when I failed to follow simple instructions.

Then came the month before the finals. While I had spent more than a year preparing for these, it was this final month where I had to step it up, to make my efforts count. Unlike the previous years, where the final scores were a cumulative of the scores obtained in different examinations with assigned weightages, the pressure I felt was different this time, because only the scores from these finals would be factored in during the admission process.

As far as I can remember, I spent most of my waking hours studying. I felt guilty whenever I felt that I was taking unnecessary breaks. My exercise time dwindled even further and there were times when I felt burnt out. To top it all, I did not perform as well in my practice tests and that only increased my anxiety about my performance.

It took an unanticipated outburst at my parents for me to realize that I had to slow down a little, take it easy. I told myself that I was not going to succeed by thinking too much about the final destination, but by focussing on the process . This meant setting incremental goals – getting a better score with each subsequent practice test, for example – and pushing the limits, slowly but surely.

Most importantly, I had let go of my own exalted aspirations and my parent’s expectations, so that I could focus on those incremental goals. Thankfully, my parents were quite supportive. They encouraged me to give my best, but also “hit the reset button” when things felt too overwhelming. This gave me the strength to plough through.

Well, I passed the examinations with flying colours. I stood 3rd in the school and surpassed my expectations. Most importantly, I felt a sense of relief surge through me as I got to know about my results. The circumstances around the announcement of my results were rather unexpected: one of the instructors took me aside after the class to tell me that I should call my mom, as she was the one who had informed him that she wished to share some important news with me. Generally, we were not allowed to use mobile phones over the course of the training during the day, but my instructor was kind enough to make an exception on this occasion.

Thanks to my excellent results, I was admitted into the National University of Singapore (NUS) to pursue a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. This was a dream come true!

However, once I had matriculated, I realized that the ballgame was different. Focussing on academics was one thing, but it was equally important to think about a career post-graduation and gain work experience through internships.

Landing an internship came with its own set of challenges, especially if as a freshman or sophomore with little prior experience. I had to build a portfolio, and I realized that it would be better to work on projects outside those that are part of curriculum.

Apart from school work and internships, I found more opportunities to network as I was part of a wider circle. True, a lot of my friends in NUS were Indians as well, but I met many more from different backgrounds, having a diverse set of experiences, just like I had during my time at NSTI.

This was also the time that I was exposed to communities, online and offline. I had to learn to manage my time better so that I could attend to all these competing interests, without feeling overwhelmed.

Even on an academic front, studying the way I used to in high school wasn’t going to cut it. I had to adapt to the continual modes of assessment, that varied based on the course. Consistency and effective study strategies were more important than the actual time spent studying.

College made me realize how my perspective about life was circumscribed and how I could look towards the horizon for pushing my limits. I hope to hold on to this attitude of curiosity and open-mindedness as I have embarked on a new journey through my career post-graduation.

This Steve Jobs quote inspires me a lot: “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you, and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”
