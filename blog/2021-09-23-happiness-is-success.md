What our parents have taught us from a young is mostly true. Hard work, determination
and focus are the basic ingredients needed to attain mastery and in turn
to become successful.

However, this applies in a more general sense. If success means achieving the ambitions
our parents have chalked out for us, then it is their definition of success, not ours.
There is no one particular definition of success because success generally means accomplishing
goals and goals are largely individualistic.

It's not wrong to follow the path shown to you by your parents, unlike what others may have you believe. But it's important to take the time out to reflect on your choices, the ones you may have made in the past as well as the ones you are about to make. 
This reflection can take several forms: meditation, journaling or even
having an internal dialogue. Whatever it is, you need to practise as regularly as possible.

Just like your body is strengthened through regular exercise and your mind is sharpened through active learning, your soul (if you believe that there is indeed such a thing) is stirred through practising self-awareness.

As you do so, you will inevitably find yourself gravitating towards your values: these one-word abstract phrases that seem to hold weight in most of the conscious decisions that you make in your life. 

Of course, these values need not be set in stone. They are likely to change as you change gradually through your life. But reflecting on your values guards you against the two extremes: plodding on mindlessly without knowing what you want or fluctuating as you let your whims and desires guide you.

They act as internal compasses that guide you through difficult times, that ensure you don't get swept up in the tides of change. Amidst the wavering winds, you remain standing erect like an unmovable mountain. 

With the deluge of information in the internet age, it is hard not to get overwhelmed. [The only panacea to this information overload is to create](https://manuswong.com/how-consumerism-is-killing-our-creativity/). Creativity does not have to look glamorous: it starts with the simple decisions you take to design your life.

When you realise that what guides you ahead is solely what you have learned, from your own experiences and from what others teach you along the way, that you free yourself from the burden. All the bells and whistles will not distract you. You will end up becoming happier, without actively trying to pursue happiness.

This is what I believe true success looks like.
