I just tuned into an episode of one of my favourite podcasts "No Stupid Questions" by Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner. I only listened to the first part of the episode (Sorry Angela and Stephen!) where they discussed why we forget so much of what we read.

My own motive behind starting a blog, which I think is shared by most other bloggers especially as they start out, is to document my life journey: how I am shaped by the different serendipitious interactions, life experiences and various forms of media that I consume. This, in a way, is a bid to remind my future self about what my current self is experiencing. Stephen, on the other hand, has tried to argue in this segment against trying to remember most of what we read or rather, about beating ourselves up if we forget the salient points of the books we read.

## Forgetting curve

That is because our brain has a "forgetting curve" just as it has a "learning curve": you forget a significant portion of what you have learned just within the span of a day. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who published a study about this effect in 1885, said that you can forget as much as 40% of what you have learned over a few days.
The dropoff rate, however, gets much slower over a longer period of time and hence the forgetting curve looks exponentially decreasing in nature.

## The role of intention
Your brain also remembers information differently based on intention. If you are focussed on trying to get the most out of what you read, unsurprisingly enough, you will end up remembering more of it. Your knowledge about the subject is of course enhanced if you practice good study techniques, such as taking notes of what you read, organising them in your personal knowledge management system and reviewing them from time to time. 

However, it's unlikely that you would do this for any of the fiction books you read, as you are instead trying to immerse yourself in the story that the author has laid out for you, just like when you are watching a film.

## The importance of context
Angela had consulted Michael Kahana, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the field of human memory, about her tendency to forget book plots. He responded to her queries by telling her that she was selling herself short. All she needed was some context, like a few sentences read from the book, to recollect the salient points of the book. 

## Much room for misinterpretation
It is gratifying to see accomplished authors like Stephen and Angela talk about forgetting most of what they have read because you then take a peek into the psyche of an author: what the author really has in mind as he is drafting a book. 

As Stephen says towards the end, "My job is to write and the reader's job is to read and forget". In other words, the burden is on the content creator because the rate of consumption far exceeds the rate of production, but the creator can relieve some of the burden of embellishing his content by keeping in mind that he cannot control how people end up intrepreting his work.
