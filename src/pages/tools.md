title: Tools
---

I was checking out [an Alfred Unsplash workflow](https://www.alfredworkflows.store/workflows/unsplash). One thing led to another, and I came upon the [section on the author's website](https://www.adamdehaven.com/uses/) which lists the tools he uses for development. I've been meaning to do the same for a while now, but I wasn't sure where I would put it. His page gave me just the kind of inspiration I needed to do so.

Here's my list of my development tools. These may change from time to time, but at least some of them will come in handy for the long haul.

<br />

## Code Editor
---
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - This way I can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (along with GitHub's computing resources) right from my browser. I was luckly to be able to get this without subscribing for GitHub Team account or GitHub enterprise, as I had signed up for their beta. If you want to use Visual Studio Code on your browser, you can try out either [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s), [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) or [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - [GitHub Dark Default Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
    - My favourite extensions:
        - [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) - I use this to track my time spent on coding
        - [GitLens](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens) - I use this to get more out of Git, such as viewing Git blame annotations
        - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) - I use this to format code, especially for my JavaScript projects
        - [Tabnine AI Autocompletion](https://www.tabnine.com/install/vscode) and [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) - I uses these for code auto completion

- [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) at work - This allows me to easily install and uninstall new versions of Jetbrains IDEs such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    - [Material Theme UI Lite](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12124-material-theme-ui-lite)
    - [Atom Material Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons)
    - My favourite plugins:
        - [Git Toolbox](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7499-gittoolbox)

<br />

## Terminal
---
- Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code and in Jetbrains IDEs
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - I use this in place of the actual Mac terminal as it renders the [Powerlevel10k Oh My ZSH Theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) more faithfully.

<br />

## Audio
---
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [FreeYourMusic](https://freeyourmusic.com/) - This app gives you the flexiblity of switching between different music streaming services as you can easily port over your playlists from one service to another.
- [Dell Pro Stereo Headset UC350](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-sg/product-support/product/dell-pro-stereoheadset-uc350/overview) for work
- [Bose QuietComfort 45 Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html#v=qc45_black) for personal use
