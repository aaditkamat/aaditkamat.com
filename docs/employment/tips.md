# Tips to do well in any job

## Notes:

- Take care of your mental and physical health
    - You are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety and bipolar at a younger age than when you are older. Make taking care of your mental health a top priority because that is essential to maintain the stamina required for a long lasting impactful career.
    If you have physical health issues, make sure that you also attend to those.
    - You can also try out Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) resources to help you better manage your mental health. If you are studying in a university, these resources might be available to you for free. Otherwise, you can try a website like Lumen
    - Use a website like Moodscope for monitoring how your mood is like at the end of the day -> Even Insight Timer has this tool built into it now
    - Try out acts of kindness each day like donating to a charity, praising someone for a good quality 
    - Practice gratitude journalling for 5 minutes - each day write down 3 things that you are grateful for
- Learning how to learn
    - In an era, where the world is moving fast and there is an information explosion leading to a rise in knowledge work, it is important to acquire the skill of metalearning i.e. learning how to learn. 
    - One of the most popular resources for this is the Coursera MOOC Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley which focuses on this skill
    - A useful learning technique is spaced repetition, which means that you test yourself on the concepts at regular intervals to aid retention of facts for the longer term. Software like Anki, known as Spaced Repetition Software, helps you with this task even more effectively. They make use of flashcards shown at flexible intervals of time to help better consolidate the words or concepts (more likely) that you are trying to learn.
    - This kind of a tool is especially quite useful when you are carrying out learning tasks like memorizing vocabulary words when you are in the first stages of picking up a new language
    - Another useful technique is Pomodoro: where you set 25 minute timers for uninterrupted focus on your tasks
- Moving to a new city
    - People tend to cluster around areas that become well known for particular things and hence shoot off as hubs. For example, New York is a financial hub (like Singapore), LA is an entertainment hub and Silicon Valley is a technological hub. These might help you connect with opportunities that you put you in a better stead in terms of a career.
    - Paul Graham has written an excellent essay about this on his website
- Mindfulness
    - Try apps like Headspace or a book on Mindfulness by Penman and Williams
    - It works almost as effectively as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
- Positive Psychology
    - You need to boost your morale sometimes on days you feel quite low and learning some CBT techniques like ABCD help you to overcome negative thinking and focus more on the positives for the day
